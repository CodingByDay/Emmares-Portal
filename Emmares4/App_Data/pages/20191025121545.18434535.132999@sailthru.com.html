<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">As he was preparing for an IPO that would make him a billionaire many times over, Mr. Neumann was surfing in the Maldives when executives in New York called to go over the all-important document that would be released to investors. Reluctant to cut his trip short, Mr. Neumann summoned a WeWork underling to the Maldives for an in-person briefing, according to people familiar with the episode.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Back in New York, Mr. Neumann spent much of the summer working on the document, known as an S-1, in the Hamptons, regularly helicoptering employees out from the city to help. His wife, Rebekah, WeWork’s chief brand officer, insisted it be printed on recycled paper, then rejected early printings as low-quality, according to people familiar with the matter. The process was set back by days and the printing shop originally hired for the job refused to work with the company. WeWork gave part of the job to a small New York paper company that rents space in one of its offices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">That’s from a Wall Street Journal article titled “The Fall of WeWork: How a Startup Darling Came Unglued,” and there is just so much more. For instance, when he was deciding which stock exchange would get WeWork’s initial public offering, founder Adam Neumann “summoned the heads of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to one of his homes in the Hamptons” and demanded that they “ban meat or single-use plastic products in their cafeterias.” Not, obviously, because that would be good for WeWork’s business, or for the liquidity and price of its stock, but because Neumann is personally anti-meat and anti-plastic,[1] and he was in charge.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I like to think about Adam Neumann not so much as a human person with individual desires, and more as a sort of vector of incentives. At every stage in the WeWork drama, up until about two months ago—and <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMjMvaG93LWRvLXlvdS1saWtlLXdlLW5vdw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B9329fd24" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="PZU4F46JTSE8" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">arguably even then</a>—he was doing the stuff that got rewarded. At the corporate level, the market (and particularly SoftBank Group Corp., WeWork’s biggest investor) highly valued fast-growing money-losing private companies that could plausibly make the case that they were “tech” and “platform” businesses; Neumann built his, uh, office-space-leasing company around that model, and it was briefly worth $47 billion.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">At the personal level, the market seemed fond of idiosyncratic visionary founders who kept absolute permanent control of their companies and talked a lot about how they didn’t care about profits or shareholder value because they were pursuing some higher mission.[2] Neumann is about as idiosyncratic as they come, and WeWork’s disdain for shareholder value and profitability was obvious, and, again, for a while, that looked like a good play. WeWork’s biggest investor <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90aGlzLWlzLW5vdC10aGUtd2F5LWV2ZXJ5Ym9keS1iZWhhdmVzLWhvdy1hZGFtLW5ldW1hbm5zLW92ZXItdGhlLXRvcC1zdHlsZS1idWlsdC13ZXdvcmstMTE1Njg4MjM4Mjc/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bcd403cd4" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">told Neumann</a> that he “appreciated how he was crazy—but thought that he needed to be crazier,” and then gave him a kajillion dollars when he achieved that goal. When people keep telling you to be crazier, and keep giving you more money as you do crazier things, you end up … well, the helicopters, and the print shops, and all the rest of it. You end up here. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Perhaps, by the way, this was all calculated and cynical, and Neumann noticed what stuff got rewarded and did it for that reason. Perhaps it was just that he was the person who was naturally most suited to doing the stuff that got the rewards. Perhaps it was a feedback loop, where he started with some modest level of innate craziness but it grew with the constant affirmation. I assume it was mostly the latter, but it doesn’t really matter. The market demanded a company like WeWork led by a founder like Neumann, and he enthusiastically provided it, and now here we are. Here we are.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The Journal story also describes how WeWork chose a bailout from SoftBank over a proposal from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to provide debt financing, and there is this surprising paragraph:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital Group agreed to buy about $1 billion of bonds, but JPMorgan hadn’t sold the rest. On Monday evening, hours before the deadline to submit bids, the bank agreed to backstop a full $5 billion, meaning it would be forced to fund the loan itself if it couldn’t find buyers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I … would not have expected JPMorgan to commit $5 billion to WeWork, this week, without having sold the debt? Weird.

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">WeWork is expected to add about 10 million square feet of new office space to its bulging property portfolio in the United States and Britain this year alone. These locations, often built out at great cost, highlight the knife-edge economics confronting executives who are trying to save the company, which this week received a last-minute lifeline from SoftBank after being forced to scrap an initial public offering.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The frenetic growth under the company’s founder, Adam Neumann, may weigh it down for years and hamper the attempts to remake WeWork, which until recently was widely considered one of the world’s most valuable start-ups.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One question about the WeWork debacle is whether it will cause a broader change in the fortunes and funding of tech startups, or whether WeWork is an idiosyncratic one-off story with few lessons for anyone else. I don’t know the answer, but it is worth saying that a pretty big part of the funding market for tech startups comes from SoftBank and its Vision Fund, and so if <em>SoftBank </em>learned any lessons from WeWork then that will have an effect on other companies. Did it? Oh yes, it apparently <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zb2Z0YmFua3MtdmlzaW9uLWZ1bmQtdHJpZXMtdG8tbG93ZXItcmlzay0xMTU3MjAwNzQxNT9tb2Q9aHBfbGVhZF9wb3Mz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B4f4f88d8" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">learned the most comically obvious lessons</a> from WeWork:</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Improving corporate governance! Imagine being the corporate governance expert at the SoftBank Vision Fund! You’ve been playing video games for two straight years but now finally you can spring into action. Apparently companies should … make money … and … not give absolute power to whimsical self-dealing founders, check.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Look, I am pointing this out not primarily to make fun of SoftBank, which is easy enough in hindsight, but to suggest that <em>these are really big changes</em>. Not just for SoftBank! Fast-growing money-losing tech-adjacent startups under the absolute control of their founders were the dominant category of big private unicorns not that long ago, and SoftBank was the leader and trendsetter and deepest pocket in funding those companies. And now, after some <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxOS8wNS8xMC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3ViZXItc3RvY2stcHJpY2UtaXBvLmh0bWw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bce0444a0" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">disappointing results</a>, SoftBank is heading in the exact opposite direction, emphasizing profitability and good governance over growth and, you know, bad governance.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Even if no one else follows SoftBank’s lead—and SoftBank is kind of off on its own in terms of how burned and embarrassed it is by WeWork—then at least one giant pile of money will no longer be rewarding that sort of 2018-vintage unicorn excess. Other private investors will face less pressure to compete with SoftBank to get into deals with high valuations and generous terms; other private companies will face less pressure to raise and spend money to compete with <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2lyZWQuY29tL3N0b3J5L2JsaXR6c2NhbGluZy1pcy1jaG9raW5nLWlubm92YXRpb24v/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bd9840e1d" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">blitzscaled</a> SoftBank companies. It is an exaggeration to say that SoftBank created the modern demand for money-losing tech-ish companies, or for goofball founders with no supervision, but SoftBank was a big part of that demand, and if SoftBank changes its focus then the market will change with it.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Unless of course this is just a thing they’re saying this week and when they actually <em>meet </em>the next weird founder running a weird company with fast growth and huge losses they will find her irresistible, that is obviously possible too.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One thing that happens in my line of work is that people who are doing a fun weird trade will sometimes call me up and tell me about it, not so much because they think that coverage might be helpful in making the trade pay off, but just because they correctly think that I will appreciate it aesthetically. They want to brag about having found a good trade, and maybe share a laugh about it with someone who also enjoys a good trade. Obviously I am happy to get these calls.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">A couple of times over the past few weeks, people have called me to talk about a Parker Drilling trade. Parker Drilling Co. is a small ($268 million market cap as of yesterday) oil services company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It would prefer to be a private company, presumably for the usual reasons that public companies sometimes regret being public. (Parker’s board of directors “has determined that the costs of being a public reporting company outweigh the benefits thereof,” <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzc2MzIxLzAwMDAwNzYzMjExOTAwMDA2OS9wa2RwcmVwcm94eS5odG0/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B465645d9" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">it says</a>.) The ordinary way for a public company to become a private company is for someone—typically a private equity firm, perhaps assisted by the company’s chief executive officer—to make an offer to buy up all of the stock from the public shareholders. But this has some disadvantages. For one thing, it requires a lot of cash, since you have to buy 100% of the stock, normally at a premium to the market price. For another thing, this approach normally gets rid of <em>all </em>of your public shareholders, or at least all but a few who are involved in the buyout group, and maybe you want some of those shareholders to stick around.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If your plan for going private is just “we want to be a private company, but we want to keep the same shareholders and not really spend any money,” that is mostly just not how it works.

The legal division between “public” and “private” companies is <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGF3LmNvcm5lbGwuZWR1L2Nmci90ZXh0LzE3LzI0MC4xMmctMg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bf128fd98" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">basically 300 shareholders</a>: If you have 300 or fewer holders, you can de-list your stock and stop making public filings; if you have more than 300 then you have to stay public.[3] At Parker Drilling, as at many companies, a lot of the shareholders <em>by number </em>only own a few shares; if you could just get rid of all the shareholders owning fewer than, say, 100 shares, then there would be fewer than 300 shareholders left, and you could delist your stock and stop making public filings. You’d still have a bunch of shareholders—up to 299—and at least initially they’d still be public-type holders, and they could still trade stock with each other, but you wouldn’t have to make SEC filings or generally deal with being public.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">And so companies sometimes do this, “go dark”[4] by getting rid of their small shareholders. You still have to <em>pay </em>the small shareholders, but it’s not a huge use of cash because they don’t have very many shares. If 299 shareholders own 99% of your stock, you can go dark by buying back only the remaining 1%.[5] That’s, uh, 99% cheaper than trying to buy every share at a premium.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One way to do this is an “odd-lot tender offer,” in which the company offers to buy back stock at a premium from anyone with 99 or fewer shares. If enough of those shareholders tender, then the company will get below 300 shareholders and be able to go dark. They don’t have to tender, though, so it’s a bit uncertain. Parker Drilling chose a different approach, which sounds much sillier when you read it but which is actually quite sensible. Here is its <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzc2MzIxLzAwMDAwNzYzMjExOTAwMDA2Ni9wcmVzc3JlbGVhc2UuaHRt/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B59d1cecd" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">announcement from September</a>:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">In order to deregister its shares of common stock, the Company must reduce its number of stockholders of record to below 300. To accomplish this, the Board is proposing to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-100 reverse stock split, in which holders of less than 100 shares of the Company’s common stock would be cashed out at a price of $30.00 per pre-split share in lieu of fractional shares. Such price represents a premium above the common stock’s closing price on September 10, 2019. Stockholders owning 100 or more shares of the Company’s common stock prior to the reverse stock split would remain stockholders in Parker. The number of shares such continuing stockholders would own following the proposed stock splits would be unchanged, as immediately after the reverse stock split a forward split of 100-for-1 would be applied to the continuing stockholders, negating any effects to them. Parker estimates that approximately 37,446 shares (or less than approximately 0.2% of the shares of its common stock currently outstanding) would be cashed out in the proposed transaction and the aggregate cost to the Company of the proposed transaction would be approximately $1,100,000, plus transaction expenses, which are estimated to be approximately $800,000, all of which Parker intends to fund using cash-on-hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Everyone who owns fewer than 100 shares would <em>automatically </em>get cashed out at $30 per share through the reverse stock split; everyone who owns 100 shares or more would notice a momentary hiccup as their 100 shares became 1 share, but then they’d split right back again and everything would be the same as before. (Except the company would not be listed on the NYSE and wouldn’t file public reports.) They’d still own the same number of shares in the same company, but all the small shareholders would be gone.[6] There were few enough of them that it would only cost $1.1 million. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Unlike a tender offer, this would be mandatory for all small shareholders, and so it requires a shareholder vote, and Parker Drilling filed a <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzc2MzIxLzAwMDAwNzYzMjExOTAwMDA2OS9wa2RwcmVwcm94eS5odG0/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115C465645d9" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">preliminary proxy statement</a> asking shareholders to vote for it. It mentioned that its biggest shareholders intend to vote in favor, presumably because they agree with the board that the costs of being public for Parker Drilling outweigh the benefits, including the benefits to them of having a liquid public stock. So it looked reasonably likely to happen. And, as the announcement said, that $30 price was a nice premium: Parker Drilling’s stock closed at $19.59 per share the day the split transactions were announced, and it has mostly been below $20 since. If you had 100 shares, they were worth about $19.59 each; if you had 99 shares, you could cash them out at $30 each.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">This is the point at which people started to call me to tell me to brag about the trade. You know what the trade is, right? It is embarrassingly simple, really, hardly worth mentioning. It’s just: Buy 99 shares of Parker Drilling stock for under $20 each, wait for the stock-split stuff to happen, and cash them in for $30. It’s free money. The downside of the trade is that it’s only about $1,000 of free money: It only works for 99 shares or fewer, so it is not an institutional-size trade. No hedge fund is running this arbitrage for its clients, though I would not be surprised if one or two hedge fund analysts are doing it in their personal accounts, just on principle. The upside, though, is that because of the size limit, the arbitrage doesn’t <em>close</em>: You can’t run this arbitrage by going out and buying Parker Drilling shares until the price converges on $30, because if you buy more than 99 shares you can no longer get the $30. So the stock never really traded up much. Nobody can get all that much free money, but because of that everyone can get their share of the free money.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Oh hahaha the other downside to the trade is that it’s not an arbitrage at all, there is and was absolutely no guarantee that Parker Drilling would actually go through with this, and the more people who noticed the trade the less likely it was that it would happen.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">And so in fact, this Monday, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18434535.132999/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzc2MzIxLzAwMDAwNzYzMjExOTAwMDA4Mi9wcmVzc3JlbGVhc2VwcmVwcm94eTIwMTlvY3QuaHRt/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B13df7621" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Parker Drilling announced</a> that the party was over. Now it is proposing to do the reverse split at a ratio of “not less than 1-for-5 and not greater than 1-for-100,” with the exact ratio set “at the discretion of the Board … without further approval or authorization of our stockholders.” If you have 99 shares, you might get cashed out at $30 per share, or you might just get rolled over into 99 shares of a no-longer-publicly-listed Parker Drilling.[7] (If you have four shares you’ll definitely get cashed out, but then you’ll make like forty bucks.)</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The company also explained the reason for the change, which is of course that people were having too much fun:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">After announcing on September 10, 2019 the stock splits at a proposed reverse stock split ratio of 1-for-100 to be followed by a forward stock split ratio of 100-for-1 and the proposed transaction to deregister and delist its common stock, the Board and its advisors observed a substantial increase in trading of the Company’s common stock. While this increased trading activity had only a nominal effect on the number of holders of record, it led to a significant increase in the number of shares that would be cashed out in lieu of receiving fractional shares at the previously proposed reverse stock split ratio, which would make the stock splits and the proposed transaction significantly more expensive for the Company.</p>

(“Only a nominal effect on the number of holders of record” suggests that’s the idea.) Another possibility: A lot of the people who got into this trade for the free money might get out after this announcement, so there will end up being fewer than 300 holders of odd lots.</em>
