If successful, AutoX will be able to test self-driving cars with only a remote human operator as a backup. AutoX is currently one of four firms that hold a license to test carrying passengers in the presence of a human backup driver. Waymo is the only company so far to have a license for testing without a safety driver. Other companies such as Uber and General Motors are vying for breakthroughs in the self-driving vehicle market. AutoX counts China's Dongfeng Motor Group and Alibaba among its main investors. It has deployed 100 RoboTaxi vehicles in 10 cities including Shenzhen, Shanghai, and San Jose.

Companies such as DoorDash have started building delivery-only kitchens and renting them out to restaurants. Restaurants can move into a DoorDash kitchen and then be live on the platform the next day. DoorDash's tenants include Chick-fil-A. Its delivery-only kitchens allow restaurants to deliver to wider areas. Restaurants can test areas without the expensive costs of setting up a full business. Uber is encouraging some of its restaurants to set up separate app-only restaurants under different names. Restaurants have been receiving additional sales from delivery apps, but the apps take around 30 percent from each order, making it tough for businesses to cover expenses.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Femilengler%2Fsysget/1/0100016edae3cb31-fd29f537-bd0c-4f89-ac9f-e1adf0774422-000000/8bZkIvDTwllvWtThk16SZ9W_1IoP2xr2YAsDkSCD_mA=118" target="_blank">sysget (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">With sysget, users only need to know one package manager syntax, rather than having to learn a new package manager for every distro. sysget can search for, install, and remove packages, as well as update databases, and more.

When deploying an application in Kubernetes, a developer usually defines three components: a Deployment, a Service, and an Ingress. When troubleshooting Kubernetes deployments, one should check that the Pods are running, then focus on getting the Service to route traffic to the Pods, and finally, check that the Ingress is correctly configured. It is important to remember to approach the problem bottom-up, starting with the Pods and moving up the stack with Service and Ingress. The same debugging technique can be applied to other objects.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2019%2F12%2F5%2F20997166%2Fapple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research/1/0100016edae3cb31-fd29f537-bd0c-4f89-ac9f-e1adf0774422-000000/XIDIzUTIymlMQGP3vp0A_8xPGlZ2yQnb2ASUOGt9mqE=118" target="_blank">Apple will reportedly release an iPhone without any ports in 2021 (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Ming-Chi Kuo has released a new research note that says that Apple's 2021 flagship iPhone will be a completely wireless device. This change will have a large impact across the tech industry, with everything from charging cable companies to headphone manufacturers being impacted. While this change is far from being confirmed, Kuo has a good reputation for predicting Apple's plans. He has predicted that Apple will release five new phones in 2020, including the iPhone SE2. In the fall, Apple is set to release four OLED iPhones, all of which will have 5G. The lineup will include four different sized phones, with a smaller 5.4-inch sized phone rumored to be released.</p> <br><br>
