<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">A good common simple reason for a merger to happen is that it will create value. Company A makes widgets, Company B makes sprockets, the widget salespeople could cross-sell the sprockets to their clients, the sprocket and widget factories could use some interchangeable parts, the human resources departments could be combined to save on costs, etc.; the standard term is “synergies.” Company A is worth $10 billion, Company B is worth $5 billion, if Company A acquires Company B the combined Company AB will be worth $17 billion. It doesn’t always work in practice—acquisitive corporate CEOs are notably optimistic, etc.—but it’s a good general idea.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">In that scenario, how much would you say Company B is “worth” in the merger? Its unaffected standalone value is $5 billion, but if you add it to Company A, it will increase Company A’s value by $7 billion. The extra $2 billion—the synergies, the value added by the merger—isn’t exactly a property of Company B, but it isn’t exactly a property of Company A either. Neither can extract it on its own.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Still, if the merger happens, that extra value exists. (I mean, it sort of exists; it clearly exists in this stylized example, and it exists in uncertain expectation in lots of real deals. It’s easier to just pretend that there’s a pot of $2 billion, though the real world is messier.) It has to be divided up somehow. If Company A pays $5 billion for Company B then Company A gets the whole extra value. If Company A pays $7 billion for Company B then Company B—technically, the shareholders of Company B who are selling it—get the whole extra value. (If Company A pays $8 billion, then Company B gets more than the whole extra value. This is a common scenario, in hindsight, in the real world, with the “winner’s curse” in merger auctions and general CEO optimism.) You’d expect, most of the time, the parties to negotiate something in between; Company B would get a third or a half or three-quarters or whatever of the value. There’s no particular formula,[1] and the actual allocation will depend on the companies’ relative leverage and the CEOs’ relative charisma and their bankers’ skill and the competitive auction dynamics and the level of uncertainty about the synergies and a bunch of other stuff.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Also though some deals <em>won’t</em> happen: Company A will want all the benefits and Company B will want all the benefits and they won’t be able to agree on a split. Or, because in the real world the benefits are uncertain, Company A will value them at $1 billion and be willing to pay half that, and Company B will value them at $3 billion and be willing to accept half that, and there will be no common ground. There are technologies to bridge this—stock-for-stock mergers give Company B shareholders some of the upside in Company A, and if you want to be more precise you can use <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQ29udGluZ2VudF92YWx1ZV9yaWdodHM/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B5f88437f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">contingent value rights</a> or earnouts or <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMTAtMTYvY2FybC1pY2Fobi13YW50cy10by1maWdodC1kZWxsLWFnYWlu/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B0b1be35b" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">tracking stock</a>—but you will still expect some deals to fail due to disagreement on valuation and how to divide it. And so the extra value won’t be created.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Seen in a certain light this is inefficient. If a merger will create $2 billion of value, then that is good, and that value should be created, and it should not be held back by petty squabbles over its allocation. (If a merger will create $1 to $5 billion of value, then that is good, and it should not be held back by petty squabbles over its exact magnitude.) One should not overstate that—some of that value will not be “created” so much as it is “appropriated away from employees and customers and bondholders and then given to shareholders instead”—but there is probably some truth to it; probably a lot of mergers do increase efficiency. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">It is particularly inefficient from the perspective of what you might call “the shareholder class.” Like if you just imagine that shareholders of all public companies are a unified group with unified interests, then adding $2 billion of shareholder value to companies is good, <em>for them</em>, even if <em>all</em> of that $2 billion is expropriated from employees and customers and bondholders. If your criterion is not <em>social </em>benefit but <em>shareholder </em>benefit—benefit for shareholders generally, not for Company A or Company B shareholders specifically—then it is efficient for value-creating mergers to happen frequently, and for Company A and Company B not to haggle too hard over who gets the benefit. The point is that <em>some </em>shareholders get the benefit, and if you took a unitary shareholder perspective that is all that would matter to you.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The unitary shareholder perspective can seem kind of unnatural—why should Company B shareholders care about increasing overall shareholder welfare, if all of that increase goes to Company A shareholders?—until you remember, oh, right, all the companies actually do have the same shareholders. There <em>is </em>a unified class of shareholders, in the form of diversified investors—often index or “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTctMDItMDkvcXVhc2ktaW5kZXhlcnMtZ3Jvd3RoLWFuZC1jb25mdXNpb24/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B03dfaad4" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">quasi-index</a>” investors—who own the shares of many or all public companies, including in particular Company A and Company B. If a majority of the shareholders of Company A are also a majority of the shareholders of Company B, and if a merger will create value, then those shareholders will want the merger to happen, and they won’t care that much about whether they get that value in the form of payment for their Company B stock or in the form of increased value for their Company AB shares. They might care a little—if you own 6% of Company A and 3% of Company B you might prefer more of the value to go to Company A, etc.—but shareholders’ specific preferences may cancel each other out, and may in any case be weaker than the general preference to get deals done and create more shareholder value.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">And so (1) if lots of public companies are owned by diversified investors who also own other public companies that they might merge with, and (2) those companies are responsive to the economic interests of their shareholders, then (3) there will tend to be more mergers among those companies, and (4) those mergers will tend to be “easier”—the targets will not push for huge cash premiums,[2] but will be more amenable to just getting a deal done.[3]</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">And that all seems to be true. “Researchers have also found that common ownership increases the likelihood of companies merging and reduces the premiums that sellers receive,” <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjAtMDEtMjMvaW5kZXgtZnVuZC1naWFudHMtZHJhdy1hbnRpdHJ1c3Qtc2NydXRpbnktaW4tdS1zLW1lcmdlci1yZXZpZXdz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B9d10b751" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">notes David McLaughlin at Bloomberg News</a>.

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Institutional cross-ownership between two firms not only increases the probability of them merging, but also affects the outcomes of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). Institutional cross-ownership reduces deal premiums, increases stock payment in M&amp;A transactions, and lowers the completion probabilities of deals with negative acquirer announcement returns. Furthermore, deals with high institutional cross-ownership have lower transaction costs and disclose more transparent financial statement information. The effect of cross-ownership on the total deal synergies and post-deal long-term performance is positive, which can be attributed to independent and non-transient cross-owners. </p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">U.S. antitrust officials have begun asking companies about communications with their biggest shareholders as part of merger investigations, according to people familiar with the matter, adding to the growing scrutiny of the power of giant index funds.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The Federal Trade Commission wants buyers and sellers to identify their largest shareholders, the extent of their influence over the companies and any communications they’ve had, said the people, who declined to be named because the matter is confidential.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The requests represent a new development in U.S. antitrust enforcement and could pose yet another hurdle to companies seeking regulatory approval for mergers. While the agency routinely digs into the reasons why companies are pursuing mergers, the new inquiry shows investigators are going further to determine the amount of influence of institutional investors.</p>

But usually the concern is different. The classic should-index-funds-be-illegal idea is that common ownership of multiple competing companies by big institutional shareholders will reduce product-market competition: Companies with the same shareholders won’t want to compete fiercely on price because that would just reduce the size of the pie for those shareholders, etc. This is different; this is a worry that common ownership is an antitrust problem because it will lead to more mergers.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One thing to say here is that it’s a bit of an odd worry for antitrust regulators. The classic product-market worry that we usually talk about is that index funds will push companies to raise prices in a coordinated way, which is an obvious antitrust harm. But mergers are not. Mergers are allowed under antitrust law! As long as they don’t have anticompetitive effects. And if you’re worried that institutional shareholders will push companies to do mergers that have anticompetitive effects, and you are <em>reviewing a merger</em>, you should just review whether the merger has anticompetitive effects. The review that the FTC does anyway—conducting economic analyses of market dynamics and pricing power, looking at internal corporate communications to see if they say things like “this deal will let us jack up prices”—is aimed at that.[4] “We are doing this merger to jack up prices” would be a problem; “we are doing this merger to jack up prices because that’s what our common institutional shareholders want” would not really <em>add </em>anything to the problem. “We are doing this merger to save money by laying off redundant workers” would mostly <em>not </em>be an antitrust problem—though you may not like that!—and, if it’s not, then “we are doing this merger to lay off redundant workers because that’s what our common institutional shareholders want” would also be fine.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">(On the other hand it is a reasonable “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMDktMTAva2VlcC15b3VyLWJpdGNvaW5zLWluLXRoZS1iYW5r/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B927f79db" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="PEUIQG6K50XS" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type"><em>hipster </em>antitrust</a>” concern: If your view of antitrust law is that it should oppose bigness and the accumulation of power in business, and protect workers and competitors, rather than focusing narrowly on consumer prices, then “common ownership leads to more mergers” will bother you as a general matter.)</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Another thing to say here is that, if the theory I sketched above is true, it doesn’t really turn on companies’ “communications with their biggest shareholders.” You don’t need Vanguard to call up the CEO and say “hey you should get this merger done.” The CEO can look at her shareholder list, look at the other company’s shareholder list, do some math, go through the very straightforward and well-known reasoning I laid out above, and conclude for herself, “hey I should get this merger done.” The key assumptions in this theory are (1) that shareholders are diversified and (2) that managers are responsive to the actual financial interests of their actual shareholders. When those financial interests are very transparent—when everyone knows who the big shareholders of Company A and Company B are, and how similar those lists are—then you don’t need secret backroom deals to get mergers done.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Also it doesn’t really turn on the <em>bigness </em>of the shareholders, or on the concentration of the “Big Three” institutional investors (BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp.). Everything I said above is more or less true if Company A and Company B are largely owned by giant index-fund complexes, or if they are largely owned by small but broadly diversified investors. If each company has thousands of shareholders who “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMTQveW91LWNhbi1idXktYWxtb3N0LWFsbC10aGUtc3RvY2tz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B4d18716d" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">direct index</a>,” their incentives will not be all that different than if they each have three shareholders who are index-fund giants.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Another thing to say is: What if it’s false? What if this whole theory is completely untrue, and corporate chief executive officers never consider the interest of diversified shareholders in making merger decisions? It is not a completely crazy thing to think. Public-company CEOs really are unusual in that they tend to have large chunks of their wealth in the form of undiversified shares of their own companies. It would be strange and scandalous for a CEO to own as much stock in her biggest competitor as she owns in her own company; it is completely typical for that to be true of her five biggest outside shareholders. So the <em>CEO </em>is not <em>personally </em>indifferent to the allocation of value in the merger, and she’s the one making the decisions. Also CEOs tend to be pretty competitive, ambitious and optimistic; a CEO might not want to sell the company she devoted years of her life to for a modest premium, putting herself out of a job, just because it would be good for the acquirer’s shareholders who are also her biggest shareholders. Maybe the interests of diversified shareholders actually <em>don’t </em>carry that much weight in merger decisions; the CEO, who has her own interests and incentives, can just tune them out. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Would that … be … good? Doesn’t it sound sort of bad? Shouldn’t the CEOs be responsive to their shareholders? If their economic incentives are different from those of shareholders, causing them to refuse to do things that shareholders want, is that entirely positive?</p>

In the U.S., one of them is antitrust law: If you’re buying more than a certain amount of stock in a company (basically <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnRjLmdvdi9uZXdzLWV2ZW50cy9ibG9ncy9jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1tYXR0ZXJzLzIwMTkvMDMvaHNyLXRocmVzaG9sZC1hZGp1c3RtZW50cy1yZXBvcnRhYmlsaXR5LTIwMTk/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bcf1eb6b2" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">$90 million worth</a>), you have to <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnRjLmdvdi9lbmZvcmNlbWVudC9wcmVtZXJnZXItbm90aWZpY2F0aW9uLXByb2dyYW0vaHNyLXJlc291cmNlcy9zdGVwcy1kZXRlcm1pbmluZy13aGV0aGVyLWhzci1maWxpbmc/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B6ed9384a" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">file with the antitrust authorities</a> so they can make sure that your acquisition isn’t anticompetitive.

If you want to buy big stakes in those companies you might need to meet certain requirements, or you might be restricted from doing other sorts of transactions, etc. Because in every case it is assumed that the big shareholders of those sorts of companies are influential, and the regulators want them to use that influence in good ways and not in bad ways. The regulatory regimes that apply to those <em>companies </em>also apply to those companies’ <em>owners</em>, because of course you can’t separate the companies from the owners.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">And then the Big Three go and buy big stakes in every single company without even really paying attention to what they’re doing, and it’s … just … weird. It doesn’t fit exactly with any<em> </em>of the regulatory regimes. Some people want to buy casinos because they are good upstanding gambling operators, and other people want to buy casinos because they are mobsters, but Vanguard isn’t buying casinos for either of those reasons. Vanguard is buying casinos—large stakes in casinos, I mean—because Vanguard is buying everything; it doesn’t care what companies it buys and it doesn’t have any plans for them. It is an omnivorous inhuman force; you can’t really ask it to fill out the same forms as everyone else.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">This has been true for a long time, and is pretty obvious, and many of the regulatory regimes—certainly antitrust and securities law—have exemptions or lighter requirements for passive investors. You can check a box saying “I just need to put my money somewhere, I have no plans to do anything to this company,” and you won’t have to comply with the full standard requirements, the ones that apply to people who buy big stakes with big plans. The regulators are aware that passive ownership does not fit neatly with the default categories, and the regulators tend to accommodate themselves to the passive owners.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Anyway here’s a client memo from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP titled “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGVydHMuZGF2aXNwb2xrLmNvbS8xMC80NzY3L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAyMC0wMS0xNy1mZWRlcmFsLWJhbmtpbmctYWdlbmNpZXMtcmVjb2duaXplLXRoZS1yaXNlLW9mLWluZGV4LWZ1bmRzLWFuZC1wYXNzaXZlLWludmVzdGluZy5wZGY_c2lkPWIyZDM1YzZkLTk4NGItNGM1Ni04NzkwLWVhNTY3NmI0YmYxYw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B8be1f0d8" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">Federal Banking Agencies Recognize the Rise of Index Funds and Passive Investing</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Two recent actions by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC (the Banking Agencies) recognize the increasing role of fund complexes and passive investing. The Banking Agencies have released a statement under the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O which acknowledges the reality that equity mutual funds may sometimes go over 10% of the shares of a banking organization without triggering limitations on loans to insiders. In addition, the Federal Reserve has recently made public a general counsel’s letter that provides conditions for when a fund complex may go over 10% equity ownership in a banking organization without triggering the Change in Bank Control Act (CIBC Act).</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">In a welcome move that appears to reveal a more nuanced acknowledgment of the reality of modern financial markets, on December 27, 2019, the Banking Agencies issued a statement announcing they would not take action related to extensions of credit by banks, thrifts and other depository institutions (Banks) to companies that may be a “related interest” of certain asset managers and their institutional accounts or investment funds they sponsor, manage or advise, including mutual funds and ETFs (collectively, Fund Complexes) for purposes of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O (the Reg O Statement). The Banking Agencies explained in the Reg O Statement that due to the wide variety of companies in which Fund Complexes invest, which includes both banking and nonbanking entities, “banks have indicated that the treatment of [companies in which a Fund Complex invests] as ‘related interests’ under Regulation O could require the sudden and disruptive unwinding of substantial preexisting lending relationships and reduce credit availability to a wide swath of financial and non-financial companies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The basic idea is that if you own more than 10% of a bank, you probably have a certain amount of influence over the bank, and if you use that influence to borrow a lot of money from the bank you might be up to no good.[5] But that is absurd in the case of the Big Three. For one thing, they are not buying big stakes in banks to control the banks; they are buying big stakes in banks because they are buying big stakes in everything. For another thing, if they can’t borrow money from the banks that they own, they can’t borrow money from <em>any </em>bank: If a giant index-fund complex owns 20% of the market, then it will own about 20% of every bank. (No one is there yet but give it time.) And so the bank regulators are like “oh fine never mind index funds are different.”</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">A rough model of corporate banking is that companies want large revolving credit lines, so that they have more flexibility to borrow money if times get bad, but their banks want to limit that optionality, because if the companies draw down the credit lines when times get bad, they may not be able to pay them back, and the banks will lose money. So the banks will limit the size of the credit lines based on the companies’ financial capacity, and they will charge a fee for undrawn amounts, to compensate the banks for the risk and to discourage the companies from getting vastly more credit than they need.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">And in consumer banking it is … the opposite? Bloomberg’s Michelle Davis reports that “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjAtMDEtMjMvYmFua3MtYXJlLXJhaXNpbmctY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtbGltaXRzLXdpdGhvdXQtYXNraW5nLWN1c3RvbWVycw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B8033442d" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">Banks Are Handing Out Beefed-Up Credit Lines No One Asked For</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">“It’s like putting a sandwich in front of me and I haven’t eaten all day,” said D’Ante Jones, a 27-year-old rapper known as D. Maivia in Houston who was close to hitting the ceiling on his Chase Freedom card when JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. nearly doubled his spending limit a year ago without consulting him. He soon borrowed much more. “How can I not take a bite out of it?” …</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">“I didn’t know there was a way to say no,” said Jones, the Texas rapper. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I mean there is absolutely a way to say no: If you don’t want to borrow more money, just don’t use your credit card! But of course if the bank is proactively raising your spending limit, for free, it is because (1) the bank expects you to use it and (2) they expect to make money out of your usage.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Or the banks respond to the article by saying stuff like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">“Capital One examines a number of factors before determining whether a customer is eligible for a credit line increase, including reviewing their credit and payment history, debt-to-income ratio and ability to pay,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Yeah no from first principles you’d expect that to be a given: If the bank is lending you money, it would like to be paid back, and so it will only lend you money if it expects you to pay it back. But in recent empirical experience that is not always how it works. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One way you might put this is that, in high finance, options have value, and you expect them to be optimally exercised. If a bank says to its sophisticated corporate client “hey if you ever need money we will give it to you,” it will expect the client to take it up on that money whenever that is a good deal for the client, which probably means it will be a bad deal for the bank. And so the bank will negotiate that option carefully, limit its exercisability, and charge for it. But in consumer finance, you can make a lot of money handing out free options if you know that they’ll be exercised badly. If a bank says to its consumer clients “hey if you ever need money we will give it to you,” it can expect the clients to take it up on that offer when it is in the bank’s interests, which may not be when it’s in the client’s.</p>

<em>[1] There are some legal rules about, for instance, valuation in merger appraisal actions, in which Company B shareholders are supposed to be paid the fair value of their company, without synergies. In practice this is <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDQtMTcvYXBwcmFpc2FsLWFyYml0cmFnZS1tYWtlcy1hLWNvbWViYWNr/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B0a3861c4" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">almost always</a> a much higher value than the standalone market price of Company B, though, which might leave you wondering where the extra value came from if not from the synergies. “Control premium” is one answer, or, like, “long-termism” is <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19242794.139748/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTctMTItMTUvYXBwcmFpc2FsLXJpZ2h0cy1hbmQtdGVjaC1mZWFycw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Ba4c289d2" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="P10BWH6S972A" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">a weirder one</a>.</em>

<em>[2] In a purely efficient world this might not matter so much: If the shareholders are really identical, then a high premium doesn’t “cost” them any more than a low one; it is just paid from one pocket to another. But in reality there are frictions: If Company A has to pay a huge cash cost that will drive up its interest expense and risk of bankruptcy, etc. Also the specific-company dynamics that I started with—Company A will want to pay a little and Company B will want to get a lot—don’t really go *away*; the CEOs will still be competitive individuals with a lot of undiversified stock in their own companies. So Company B being amenable to accepting a “normal” premium seems a bit more likely than Company A being amenable to paying an abnormally huge one.</em>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">
<em>[3] Oh by the way conversely some deals will destroy value. They’ll be good for Company B shareholders (who get to sell at a premium), very bad for Company A shareholders (who both pay the premium and are left holding the value destruction), and bad, on net, for shareholders overall. You might expect those deals to be less common with widespread diversified owners: While Company A’s shareholders should always oppose them, you might expect Company B’s shareholders, as diversified investors, to oppose them too. Unitary-shareholder efficiency should mostly make mergers more common and easier, but it should also make it harder to do the mergers that are inefficient for shareholders.</em>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">
<em>[4] Certainly if the CEO told her institutional shareholders “this deal will let us jack up prices,” that would be of interest to the FTC, but they have been asking about those sorts of communications for decades.</em>
