<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Doesn’t it sound like a “global insider trading ring” should be a powerful shadowy network of senior executives at big investment banks and other advisory firms who feed information to leading hedge fund managers? There are occasional glimpses of that world—the head of McKinsey &amp; Co. <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18423265.138071/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxOS8wMy8yMi9idXNpbmVzcy9kZWFsYm9vay9yYWphdC1ndXB0YS11bnJlcGVudGFudC5odG1s/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B0a3b8296" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">once fed secret information</a> from a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. board meeting to the head of a multibillion-dollar hedge fund!—and it is fun to imagine that those are the tip of the iceberg, that there is a secret Illuminati of illegal trading at the heart of the capital markets.</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">U.S. prosecutors announced criminal charges against six people in what they described as a global insider-trading ring that generated tens of millions of dollars in profits.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The charges announced Tuesday include Joseph El-Khouri, 52, a securities trader who lives in London and Monaco. Bloomberg News has previously reported on the cases against the other five people charged, including an investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bryan Cohen, accused of passing confidential information to a securities trader in Switzerland. … Among those accused are Benjamin Taylor, 35, who previously worked at Moelis &amp; Co., and Darina Windsor, 32, who had worked at Centerview Partners LLC in London. They’re charged with passing inside information on 22 companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Goldman and Moelis and Centerview are big names, but these particular people were pretty junior. It is unclear from the complaints how they all got involved with each other, and frankly <em>whether </em>they were all involved with each other; this seems to have been less a “ring” of criminals with gang signs and a joint esprit de corps, and more a loosely overlapping network of people who got tips from some of the other people. I hope someone put out an ad for, like, “international bankers wanted for secret insider trading ring,” and these were the random people who showed up.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Still, some of them showed some spirit. Taylor and Windsor, two of the alleged tipsters, were in a romantic relationship with each other, and while they “used encrypted messaging applications and unregistered ‘burner’ cellphones to communicate with each other and arrange in-person meetings to discuss their scheme,” <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18423265.138071/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuanVzdGljZS5nb3YvdXNhby1zZG55L3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvZmlsZS8xMjEyMTM2L2Rvd25sb2Fk/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B2efc710c" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta itemprop="type" content="WebLink">they also allegedly did this</a>:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">On or about October 10, 2012, WINDSOR sent an email to TAYLOR titled “Once upon a time, there was a Pops searching for Truffles in the Forest ...” “Pops” and “Popsy” were names that TAYLOR and WINDSOR used to refer to each other. Attached to the email was confidential information relating to Onyx, one of Investment Bank B’s [i.e. Centerview’s] clients, which WINDSOR had obtained from Investment Bank B’s computer systems.</p>

<li style="padding-left: 0; Margin-left: 1em; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Also don’t <em>attach the information</em>, that really undermines the secrecy.</li>

On the other hand <em>calculating the number of $100 bills required for a transaction </em>is absolutely not standard practice in investment banking. There’s not generally a line in the merger spreadsheet calculating the purchase price in briefcases full of cash. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Disappointingly Windsor and Taylor were not indicted as “DARINA WINDSOR, a/k/a POPS,” etc.; the securities prosecutors still have a lot to learn from the mob prosecutors.

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The SEC alleges that the traders, who are primarily based in China, manipulated the prices of thousands of thinly traded securities by creating the false appearance of trading interest and activity in those stocks, thereby enabling them to reap illicit profits by artificially boosting or depressing stock prices. For example, according to the SEC's complaint, the traders used multiple accounts to place several small sell orders to drive down a stock’s price before using a different set of accounts to buy larger amounts of the stock at the artificially low prices. After accumulating their position, the traders then flipped the script and placed several small buy orders to push up prices so they could then sell their stock at artificially high prices.</p>

How do you do some (“manipulative”) buying and selling noisily, in a way that moves the price in your favor, and other (“real”) buying and selling silently, in a way that doesn’t move the price against you? You need some sort of specific market-microstructure explanation of how that would work, some reason why markets would sometimes respond to supply and demand by moving dramatically and other times not respond at all.</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">One or more helper accounts placed orders on stock exchanges to sell a thinly traded security at prices below the prevailing national best bid or offer (“NBBO”). These orders had two related functions: (1) sell orders placed at prices at or below the prevailing national best bid (“NBB”) were used to lower the NBB by removing buying interest at that price level, and (2) sell orders placed at prices above the prevailing NBB and below the prevailing national best offer (“NBO”) were used to set new, lower NBOs.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">After the NBBO had been artificially depressed, one or more winner accounts placed large buy orders on non-exchange venues. The operator(s) of the winner accounts typically placed the orders from accounts at different brokerage firms and/or in different names than the helper accounts. These winner account orders were often placed while there were outstanding sell orders from helper accounts that should have at least partially filled them. However, because the operator(s) of the winner accounts caused their orders to be sent to non-exchange venues, the winner and helper account orders rarely crossed. Instead, the winner account orders were usually filled at artificially high or low prices within the manipulated NBBO at non-exchange venues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The trick here is a sort of arbitrage between stock exchanges, where prices are displayed publicly, and “non-exchange venues” where they aren’t. “Non-exchange venues” include dark pools (venues that banks and brokers operate that allow institutions and high-frequency traders to trade with each other without publicly displaying prices), internalizers (brokers filling orders from their own inventory) and wholesalers (high-frequency traders who get orders from retail brokers, fill them from inventory, and pay the retail brokers for the orders). Orders on stock exchanges are “lit”: You can see the highest bid price that someone is willing to pay for a stock (and how much they’re willing to buy), and the lowest offer price that someone is willing to accept for it (and how much they’re willing to sell), and if you want to sell quickly you can hit the bid and sell immediately at that price. Orders on other venues generally aren’t lit, but they price based on the lit prices on the exchange: A dark pool or wholesaler can’t buy stock from you for less than the national best bid on a lit stock exchange, and in fact will often give you “price improvement,” paying you a bit more for your stock than you’d get on an exchange.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">All of this stuff is super controversial in various directions, and we <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18423265.138071/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMTAtMTYvY2FybC1pY2Fobi13YW50cy10by1maWdodC1kZWxsLWFnYWlu/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B10db124d" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="PGP6YS6KLVRB" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">talk</a> <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18423265.138071/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDEtMjMvcnVubmluZy1hLWhlZGdlLWZ1bmQtaXNuLXQtYWxsLWJhZA/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B57b6cb02" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="PLSN096S9728" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">sometimes</a> about how angry people get at wholesalers paying retail brokers for order flow, but the point here is that it opens up a nice little trade for manipulators. You find a small stock that doesn’t trade that much. Electronic market makers will quote it on stock exchanges, but their quotes will be small (for not that many shares) and wide (the bid price they’re willing to pay for the stock is much lower than the offer price they’re willing to accept for it). Perhaps the quote will be $9.12 bid / $9.43 offered.[2] You send orders to the stock exchanges to sell small lots (1 to 100 shares) “at progressively lower prices from $9.41 to $9.12 per share,” which have the effect of (1) lowering the best offer (because now you are offering shares at lower prices than $9.43) and (2) actually selling some shares and “taking out” the best bid (because whoever was bidding $9.12 will buy your shares at $9.12). You won’t sell that many shares, but you’ll sell some, and the market will reprice to, say, $9.05 bid / $9.14 offered.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If you then just sent buy orders to the stock exchange, the stock would reprice right back up and you’d lose money, but you don’t. Instead you do a big off-exchange trade:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Xiaosong Wang placed, directly or indirectly, an order to buy 6,000 shares of CSSE with a limit price of $9.20 per share through an account in his own name. The 6,000 share order was immediately filled by another market participant at a price of $9.127 per share.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Why would that “other market participant”—a wholesaler or internalizer, or a market maker in a dark pool—do that trade with you? Well the very rough theory is something like (1) the lit market price—the national best bid and offer—is “right,” so if you do a trade at a price between the bid and offer then you are getting a fair price, and (2) trades on non-exchange venues are not supposed to <em>move </em>the price: If you trade 6,000 shares in a dark pool, that is all the stock you want to buy and you will not go out to public markets and push up the price; if you buy 6,000 shares from a wholesaler, you are a retail customer and, again, you will not go out and push up the price. And so the wholesaler (or whoever) is happy to sell you stock at $9.127, a little bit lower than the best public-market price, because the point of the off-exchange venue is to cherry-pick “good” orders that will not move the price as much as orders in the public markets. Or that is the idea.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">But in fact you are a very “bad” order, and after you buy a lot of stock off-exchange at the new lower price, you go back and buy small lots of stock on the exchange, pushing the price right back up. And then when it’s high again you unload your stock, at the new high price, off the exchange.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">A recurring theme around here is that it is weirdly hard to define “market manipulation.” On the one hand this is the absolutely most classic stereotype of market manipulation: selling stock to push down the price to artificial levels so you can buy, then buying stock to push up the price so you can sell. On the other hand it is a little hard to spot the <em>fraud </em>here: Unlike pump-and-dump schemes, these traders weren’t publishing false rumors about the stock; unlike in spoofing, they were putting in many “manipulative” orders that were intended to (and did) execute[3]; unlike in wash trading, they weren’t just trading back and forth with themselves to create a fake price. They were creating real prices by really selling stock to willing buyers on the stock exchange. And then they were trading at those real prices in other venues. The bad part is that they took advantage of a quirk in market structure, one that makes it possible to do a manipulation that otherwise shouldn’t work.</p>

He says the company, which develops websites, apps and e-commerce platforms, was profitable in 2018, the first full year he owned it. He says happier employees deliver better work for clients, and the shorter workday is a draw, boosting recruitment in Germany’s tight labor market. </p>
