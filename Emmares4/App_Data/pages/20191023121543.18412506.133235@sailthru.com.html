<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Well obviously there will be a Harvard Business School case study about WeWork, but what will it say? What is the lesson? It’s a <em>good </em>lesson, right? A lot of kids starting at Harvard Business School next fall will be hanging up posters of Adam Neumann in their dorm rooms. Neumann, the founder of WeWork, will walk away from this corporate bonfire with a billion dollars and a bunch of fancy houses. His great-grandchildren will be prominent philanthropists with their names on museums and universities, the strange origin of their fortunes long forgotten. Neumann did a certain sort of capitalism—one with some cachet at HBS!—as well as anyone has ever done it. It is one thing to build a successful company that creates a lot of value and take some of that value for yourself; Neumann created a company that destroyed value at a blistering pace and nonetheless extracted a billion dollars for himself. He lit $10 billion of SoftBank’s money on fire and then went back to them and demanded a 10% commission. What an absolute legend.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">My very favorite part of the Adam Neumann legend might be the story of his first encounter with Masayoshi Son, who runs SoftBank Group Corp. and invests its vast piles of money. (One insane aspect of this encounter is that it happened <em>in 2017</em>. A busy two years!) “Mr. Neumann has told others that Mr. Son appreciated how he was crazy—but thought that he <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90aGlzLWlzLW5vdC10aGUtd2F5LWV2ZXJ5Ym9keS1iZWhhdmVzLWhvdy1hZGFtLW5ldW1hbm5zLW92ZXItdGhlLXRvcC1zdHlsZS1idWlsdC13ZXdvcmstMTE1Njg4MjM4Mjc/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Ba1d24ba1" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">needed to be crazier</a>.”<a href="#footnote-1" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">[</a>1] I like to imagine that conversation with the hindsight of the last few months:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">WeWork, in danger of running out of cash in the coming weeks, chose a rescue offer from SoftBank over a competing proposal from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., according to people familiar with the matter. It had asked both parties to submit proposals by a deadline yesterday.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The deal is expected to value the company at about $8 billion, a far cry from what it was aiming for in an initial public offering earlier this year and even less than the $47 billion at which a January investment from SoftBank pegged its worth.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Mr. Neumann, who was forced out as chief executive after pushback from prospective investors scuttled the IPO, has the right to sell $970 million of shares, or roughly one-third of his stake, in a so-called tender offer in which SoftBank will offer to buy up to $3 billion in WeWork stock from employees and investors.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The Japanese conglomerate, which already owns about a third of the company, will also extend Mr. Neumann credit to help him repay a $500 million loan facility led by JPMorgan, the people said. It will also pay him a $185 million consulting fee. ...</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">As part of the deal, which We was expected to announce as soon as Tuesday, SoftBank would move up a $1.5 billion investment it had been scheduled to make next year and extend the company a $5 billion loan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">That’s <em>nine point five billion dollars </em>that SoftBank is putting into WeWork,[3] on top of the <em>more than nine billion dollars</em> it has already put into WeWork, an astounding total of <em>more than $18.5 billion </em>for a company it values at $8 billion.[4] And while WeWork is desperate for the $1.5 billion equity investment and the $5 billion loan—it is running out of cash and “so strapped that it could not afford severance payments for the employees it plans to lay off,” <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMjIvYXMtYmFkLWFzLXdld29yay1pcy1pdC1jb3VsZC1nZXQtZXZlbi13b3JzZS1mb3Itc29mdGJhbms/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bfd69cdc7" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">notes my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Shira Ovide</a>—the $3 billion tender offer seems a little gratuitous? That is not money that is going to keep WeWork afloat; that is just cashing out other investors to leave SoftBank holding more of the bag. (The bailout will give SoftBank <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMjMvd2V3b3JrLXVudmVpbHMtc29mdGJhbmstcmVzY3VlLXBhY2thZ2UtbmV1bWFubi10by1sZWF2ZS1ib2FyZA/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bdb5c827e" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="PZTGEST1UM0W" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">about 80% ownership</a>.) Presumably—though who knows!—SoftBank does not have <em>limitless </em>money to pour into WeWork, so it’s strange that such a big chunk of its WeWork rescue investment is <em>not </em>going to fund the company.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Perhaps the motivation is that SoftBank are true believers and don’t want their deep-value bet on SoftBank to be diluted by other shareholders. But my assumption is that the tender offer is the result of Neumann’s holdup power: Prior to the deal, Neumann is still the company’s controlling shareholder, and he could just say no to a deal that he didn’t like. That might completely evaporate his own wealth, but it would evaporate a whole lot more of SoftBank’s, and it kind of looks like SoftBank blinked first: In effect, the price of Neumann allowing SoftBank to rescue WeWork was that SoftBank had to hand Neumann a billion dollars for himself. One <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly9ueW1hZy5jb20vaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlci8yMDE5LzA2L3dld29yay1hZGFtLW5ldW1hbm4uaHRtbA/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bc708f112" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">version</a> of that Son/Neumann origin myth has Son telling Neumann that “in a fight, being crazy is better than being smart,” and you can see a little of that in this negotiating dynamic. As his company’s value vanished due to his own hubris and weirdness, Neumann went back to his biggest investor for more desperately needed money, and somehow <em>he </em>held all the cards.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em"><em>Certainly </em>that $185 million consulting fee is a result of his holdup power.[5] But to be fair there is a consulting arrangement, and a four-year noncompete.

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">When WeWork first filed the hilarious paperwork for its IPO, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDgtMTkvd2UtbG9va3Mtb3V0LWZvci1vdXItc2VsdmVz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115C21a728c3" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">I wrote about</a> some of the governance red flags—not so much Neumann’s absolute lifetime-and-beyond control of the company, but his apparent willingness to enrich himself at the expense of shareholders. It all struck me as ominous. If the founder-CEO-controlling-shareholder is doing all that stuff <em>before </em>the IPO, I wondered, what will he do later when the profits roll in? If WeWork ends up creating a lot of value, how can you be sure that Neumann won’t find ways to appropriate a lot of it for himself rather than sharing it with his investors? In hindsight, this was insufficiently cynical. In the event, WeWork ended up <em>destroying </em>a ton of value between that IPO filing and now, and Neumann found new ways to enrich himself anyway.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">It is easy—and basically correct—to say that, you know, that’s bad, he doesn’t deserve the money, it should pay for employee severance instead.

He did this in sometimes <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV1dGVycy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS91cy1nb2xkbWFuLXNhY2hzLWFiYWN1cy1sYXdzdWl0LWlkVVNLQk4xMlkyVzQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B34592212" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">controversial ways</a>, and of course the actual bursting of the bubble that he correctly predicted led to a lot of real human hardship.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Nonetheless the thing he did is a normal and mostly praiseworthy, or at least okay, financial thing. He identified an irrationality in the market and got on the other side of it. He saw prices that were wrong and moved them toward right. By betting against other people’s mistakes, he gave them incentives to correct them. He made the markets more efficient, he improved the allocation of capital, he did his small part to speed humanity’s progress out of ignorance and into enlightenment. I mean, it’s fine, I don’t want to overstate the moral case here or anything, but it’s fine.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I can’t quite say that Neumann improved the allocation of capital, but there are certain parallels. Neumann too … look, here I am speculating, and I don’t mean to speak for Neumann’s subjective experience of his WeWork career, but from the outside, in hindsight, objectively, one could describe it like this: He spotted a bubble in venture-subsidized fast-growing money-losing capital-intensive low-margin tech-adjacent companies, noticed in particular that SoftBank seemed to be on the long side of that bubble, and set himself up to profit on the other side—by raising money for his own ultra-unicorn, by setting up the governance of that unicorn in a maximally self-interested way, and by selling and margining a bunch of his personal shares.[6] When investors like SoftBank were frenziedly buying unicorn stock, he was frenziedly selling it. He set himself up to profit from the collapse of the unicorn bubble, and accelerated that collapse. Lessons were learned, and he taught them. Now he’s rich.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">“Capitalism occasionally makes huge mistakes,” is part of the story, but the other part is that there are rich rewards for those who spot the mistakes and bet against them. This is a lesson specifically of <em>financial </em>capitalism: In most businesses you can notice a competitor doing a dumb thing and create value by doing a better thing, but the financial markets are special because you can notice a competitor doing a dumb thing and get rich by taking the other side, <em>without </em>creating value or doing a better thing. If you notice that people are buying dumb unicorn shares for too much money, you don’t have to invent a better way of doing business or of funding companies. You can just sell them as many as possible of the dumbest possible unicorn shares; when the bubble bursts, you collect your winnings. This sort of thing—getting rich by being smarter than your counterparties, making markets more efficient by being on the right side of bets—is a classic path to wealth creation in the financial business. Tech, traditionally, has a different ethos, one of getting rich by changing the world. But sometimes there are crossovers, and anyway maybe WeWork was never really a tech company.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">“Private markets are the new public markets,” I often say, meaning both that companies that once would have gone public can now stay private longer while still raising lots of money, and also that traditionally public-market investors are increasingly investing in private markets. But that doesn’t mean that there are no more differentiations between types of companies or investors or funding rounds. It’s not that brand-new startups raise multibillion-dollar Series A rounds from Fidelity. Just like in the past, there still tends to be a discrete point where a company decides to raise a large funding round and open itself up to big public institutional investors. It’s just that in the past that point was the initial public offering, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMjIvdGhlLWJpZy1tb25leS1pbi1zdGFydHVwcy1jb21lcy1mcm9tLWludmVzdGluZy1iZWZvcmUtdGhlLWlwbw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bc15f0b2f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">but now it’s the “FPO”</a>:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">“The overall level of interest in doing investments ahead of IPOs is insane—it’s through the roof,” says Andrea Walne, a partner at Manhattan Venture Partners LLC, which focuses on this market. “People feel as though they can lock in the same value as the VCs they admire and respect.” Her business card reads “Tomorrow’s IPOs Today,” with a trademark symbol above the phrase.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Promoters of private investing say the new IPO is the FPO—the final private offering. Even big mutual fund companies including BlackRock, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Wellington have embraced private investments. So far this year, 27% of VC rounds that raised more than $100 million had at least one such “crossover” investor normally focused on public markets. That’s up from 13% in 2017, according to Silicon Valley Bank. “The pace of opportunities has increased in recent years,” says Tom Watson, director of equity research for North America at T. Rowe Price. The fund company has invested in 15 privately held startups in 2019, compared with 10 for all of 2013, according to PitchBook data. Hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices have also piled in.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">It’s not that public and private are the same, it’s that the boundaries between them have moved, and what used to be true of early-stage public companies is now true of late-stage private companies.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Two points about this shift. One is that it should make IPOs a lot less fun.

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The other point is that if this shift is permanent and growing, you should expect to see it sort of formalized at investment banks. Banks that put a lot of effort and creativity into pitching IPOs, and that compete fiercely for the fees and league-table credit involved, might start putting some of the same effort into pitching FPO advisory assignments. If FPOs are where the money is, you should expect them to be where the banks are too.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Let’s assume that it’s bad for U.S. investors to invest in Chinese companies. I’m not saying that that’s necessarily the case, but some people clearly believe it, so let’s just grant it for now. It is bad for America for American investors to buy shares of Chinese companies, for whatever reason, let’s say.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Given that assumption, who should be responsible for making sure that American investors do not buy shares of Chinese companies? There are two obvious approaches. There is the personal-responsibility approach, in which most of us just agree that it is bad to buy Chinese shares, so we don’t. There’s no law against it, and some antisocial contrarian investors can still do it, but by and large most investors decline to buy Chinese shares in the same way that they declined to buy, you know, WeWork shares.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">And then there is the democratic-decision-making approach, in which we collectively declare that it is bad to buy Chinese shares and then our elected government implements that social judgment by passing a law forbidding U.S. investment in Chinese shares. (There <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDktMzAvdHJ1bXAtb2ZmaWNpYWxzLXBsYXktZG93bi1yZXBvcnRzLW9mLWNoaW5hLWludmVzdG1lbnQtbGltaXRz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B2a0cce24" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">were recent rumors</a> that something like this might happen.) Then there <em>is </em>a law against it, and some U.S. investors will find some loophole that allows them to do it anyway, but by and large most investors decline to buy Chinese shares in the same way that they decline to buy <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDItMDQvaW52ZXN0b3JzLXRyYXBwZWQtYXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLXNhbmN0aW9ucy1wdXQtZW5kLXRvLWJvbmQtdHJhZGluZw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B7f8cbf37" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">Venezuelan government bonds</a>. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">There are obvious merits to both approaches. The first reflects the function of the capital markets as a tool for aggregating preferences: If American investors mostly agree that investing in China is bad, then they mostly won’t, and the extent of that agreement will be reflected in their allocations and in market prices. The second reflects the function of democratic governments as a tool for aggregating preferences: If American citizens mostly agree that investing in China is bad, then they can collectively vote to ban it, and their government’s policies will reflect their moral choices. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The fun third approach is to decide that index providers are the unacknowledged legislators of the world. <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18412506.133235/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMjEvcnViaW8tbXNjaS1maWdodC1vdmVyLXUtcy1yZXRpcmVtZW50LWRvbGxhcnMtZ29pbmctdG8tY2hpbmE/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B992ed55e" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">Here’s this</a>:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">MSCI’s response comes after the Florida Republican sent a public letter asking the index provider for an explanation on why it added hundreds of Chinese stocks to its benchmark emerging markets index since last year and then increased the weighting to them this year. The moves paved the way for billions of dollars more in investments and retirement-savings to flow to Chinese companies. … </p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Rubio’s pressure on MSCI is part of a larger campaign by U.S. lawmakers to slow the spigot of money that has flowed from U.S. investment funds into Chinese companies. The moves come during an ongoing trade war between the two countries that has prompted U.S. officials to increase scrutiny to the money going into China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The thing to notice is that, just like markets and democracy, stock-market indexes are a tool for aggregating preferences. They are a fuzzier tool, though, less democratic than government and less flexible than markets. But they do reflect demand: An index provider effectively tells people (index funds, index-hugging active funds) what stocks they are allowed to invest in, but the index provider is in a for-profit business and it tells people what stocks to invest in based on what stocks they want to invest in. Index providers will add Chinese stocks to emerging markets indexes if emerging markets investors want to invest in Chinese stocks, and not if not. MSCI is not the shadowy power making unilateral arbitrary decisions about whether Americans should invest in China. It is reflecting the market, as well as shaping it.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Still, whatever, if investors are going to offload their investing decisions onto index providers, I guess it is kind of fair for legislators to offload their legislative decisions onto index providers. Maybe MSCI <em>is </em>the best institution for aggregating preferences; maybe it can weigh the popular demands of democratically elected governments against the financial demands of capital allocators. Maybe the best way to make decisions in a capitalist democracy is for an index provider to take inputs from retirement savers and elected senators, and to balance them in its own judgment. It seems unlikely to me, but the point here is that both the investors and the politicians seem to believe it.</p>

My model doesn’t require you to think that your startup is dumb! You don’t need to worry about Neumann’s personal beliefs and motivations at all, really. You can just think of him as a product of the invisible hand of the market. A lot of money was pouring into startups, there was a lot of demand, and the demand called forth supply, and the people who supplied the supply got rich; it is elemental and straightforward and has very little to do with questions like ‘is this a good business model?’” </em>
