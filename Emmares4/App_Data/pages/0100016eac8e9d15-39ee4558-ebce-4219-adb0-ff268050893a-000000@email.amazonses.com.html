The loop would run from Africa to Europe to Asia. AeroSlider will be 820 feet long, much larger than the Airbus A380, the largest passenger plane jet ever in service.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falirezadir%2FProduction-Level-Deep-Learning/1/0100016eac8e9d15-39ee4558-ebce-4219-adb0-ff268050893a-000000/0YyZDCLpu9wPfP97K78WI9Egr4k6C4IJvX1zq8LNG1o=116" target="_blank">A Guide to Production Level Deep Learning (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">This repository contains engineering guidelines for building production-level deep learning systems which can be deployed in real-world applications.

Elon Musk had tweeted out his congratulations, but then later in the week he tweeted a video of the Cybertruck pulling an F-150 uphill. The clip has been viewed almost 13 million times. Critics have pointed out that the F-150 is a rear-wheel drive and that there was no payload to put more weight on its rear wheels to give it more traction. Sundeep Madra, the vice president at Ford X has tweeted back at Musk, saying that Ford would complete a real comparison if Musk would send him a Cybertruck. Musk has accepted the challenge.</p> <br><br>
