    <p>Dear ,</p>
    
        
   <p>Here is your customized Science X Newsletter for April  6, 2020:</p>

	   <p style="margin:0;padding-bottom:10px;">In order to tackle the tasks that they are designed to complete, mobile robots should be able to navigate real world environments efficiently, avoiding humans or other obstacles in their surroundings. While static objects are typically fairly easy for robots to detect and circumvent, avoiding humans can be more challenging, as it entails predicting their future movements and planning accordingly.</p>

	   <p style="margin:0;padding-bottom:10px;">An International research team led by Dr. Oliver Schmidt, working at Chemnitz University of Technology (TU Chemnitz) and Leibniz IFW Dresden has recently developed a microrobitic system with a wide range of possible applications, ranging from completing micro-surgeries to delivering goods to humans. This robot, presented in a paper published in Nature Electronics, builds on an idea introduced by the same team of researchers almost a decade ago.</p>

	   <p style="margin:0;padding-bottom:10px;">Admit it. Somewhere in your basement or attic are dust-covered boxes filled with your Dad's old cassette tape music collection (your Mom is likely tidier and disposed of hers years ago.) Although last year there was an uptick in sales for audio cassettes at levels not achieved since the early 2000s, the format generally has been considered a useless relic of a long-gone era.</p>
