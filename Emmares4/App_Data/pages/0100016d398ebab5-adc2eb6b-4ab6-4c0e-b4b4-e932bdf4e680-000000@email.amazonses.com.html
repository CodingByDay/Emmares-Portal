Here’s what we know so far (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The People's Bank in China is rumored to be almost ready to launch a digital version of the renminbi. It is unknown whether it will use blockchain technology or how private the system will be. The announcement of Facebook's Libra has apparently accelerated China's plan to roll out its own digital currency. China aims to use the currency to protect its monetary sovereignty. There are many electronic payment methods in China already, with private companies handling trillions of dollars' worth of transactions per quarter. A government-owned currency would be more secure in the case of a private company declaring bankruptcy. The currency is likely to be similar to Libra. China aims to strike a balance between anonymous payments and preventing money laundering. The new digital tokens will be able to be used without an internet connection. </p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fmach%2Fscience%2Fhuge-space-hotel-promises-fake-gravity-supersized-basketball-ncna1051596/1/0100016d398ebab5-adc2eb6b-4ab6-4c0e-b4b4-e932bdf4e680-000000/t9sGO4l2JUmuAqBEYooJL0eHFzovWL7wzPWzUjKpPWo=106" target="_blank">Huge space hotel promises fake gravity and 'supersized basketball' (6 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Space hotels will soon become a reality, with NASA opening up the International Space Station to tourists in 2020, the opening of the Aurora Station planned for 2022, and the Gateway Foundation recently announcing the Von Braun Rotating Space Station, a space-based cruise ship which can accommodate 100 guests and three times as many crew members. The foundation aims to have the facility open by 2027. A 12-day stay on board the Aurora Station will cost $9.5 million including transportation. Prices for the Von Braun Station have not yet been determined. Seven people have paid Russia more than $20 million each to spend time on the ISS. The Von Braun Station will have artificial gravity, meaning that guests will be able to move about normally. There are safety concerns, as space debris could potentially damage spacecraft. </p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdaumann%2FECMAScript-new-features-list/1/0100016d398ebab5-adc2eb6b-4ab6-4c0e-b4b4-e932bdf4e680-000000/CqRyuQPLqYWjwEb6zA97UHXRweQ6ArbmNB9V0XZ4Syk=106" target="_blank">ECMAScript-new-features-list (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">This repository contains a comprehensive list of new ES features.

(Hacker News Thread)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">As a developer, finding  freelance work can be difficult, especially with popular freelancing platforms being flooded with low-quality programmers who place low bids to win projects. While there are many sources and avenues to find employment, the key is to  develop sales skills and set yourself apart from the crowd. Employers and companies receive applications all the time, and if an application is generic, it is easy to ignore. Being proactive by creating a portfolio of work and then presenting it correctly will help developers gain more higher-quality jobs than just exploring new job platforms or randomly contacting potential employers. </p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F9%2F13%2F20865042%2Fdisney-ceo-bob-iger-apple-board-streaming-service-tv-plus-pixar/1/0100016d398ebab5-adc2eb6b-4ab6-4c0e-b4b4-e932bdf4e680-000000/bH7OnE2FHNZ0UtVDCPh7UOFE6twHmVh9z3ZnaQ4OnnM=106" target="_blank">Disney CEO Bob Iger has resigned from Apple’s board (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Disney CEO Bob Iger resigned from Apple's board on September 10, the same day that Apple unveiled the launch date and subscription price for the Apple TV Plus. The introduction of the Apple TV Plus service officially makes Apple and Disney competitors, with Disney launching Disney+ on November 12. Iger's departure from Apple's board is similar to when Google CEO Eric Schmidt left after Android became a competitor to the iPhone. Apple TV Plus will launch on November 1 with nine titles for $4.99 a month. </p> <br><br>
