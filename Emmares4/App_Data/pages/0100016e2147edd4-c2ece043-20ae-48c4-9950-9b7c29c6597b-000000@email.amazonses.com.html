The executive has filed a lawsuit against Juul, claiming that he was retaliated against for raising concerns about the contaminated shipment. He had other concerns about the actions of the company, including the company shipping out pods that were almost a year old. Juul claims that the executive was terminated due to a lack leadership qualities. The company says that that the allegations about the safety and quality of its products are meritless. A nationwide lung injury outbreak now stands at 1,604 cases and 34 deaths. These illnesses are likely linked to vaping black-market THC. However, the connection to nicotine vaping products, such as those produced by Juul, has not been fully ruled out.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fabundary.com%2Fsamsung-foldable-phone-concept%2F/1/0100016e2147edd4-c2ece043-20ae-48c4-9950-9b7c29c6597b-000000/D2yyRj4Sau-nzFCcao7y8UlODsbH6IuIPZRbA4Zg9OQ=113" target="_blank">Samsung gives us a glimpse of another foldable phone and it’s pretty nice (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Samsung has revealed another foldable smartphone at its annual developer conference.

Starship is designed to launch with Super Heavy, both of which are designed to be fully reusable with low costs. The cost of launching materials with this setup could be reduced to 1000 times less than launches with Shuttle. It would be a profitable venture if it were to launch any payload currently in the market. SpaceX is looking to build dozens of Starships, and could potentially launch a million tonnes to orbit per year, far existing the current launch market of 500 tonnes per year. Starship is designed for building nations in space. It is capable of launching supplies, such as food, fuel, and heavy construction equipment, into space at an incredible rate at a low cost.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Finformation-technology%2F2019%2F10%2Findian-nuclear-power-company-confirms-north-korean-malware-attack%2F/1/0100016e2147edd4-c2ece043-20ae-48c4-9950-9b7c29c6597b-000000/lzYSnL4AVjbX5any_P7KgNLoTRhMcVFX7J6ugbogAiY=113" target="_blank">Indian nuclear power plant’s network was hacked, officials confirm (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Malware attributed to North Korean state actors has been discovered on the administrative network of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in India. The company admitted the discovery a day after it denied that any attack would affect the plant's control systems. Malware was discovered on a computer used for administrative purposes, which is isolated from the critical internal network. Other nuclear plants may be affected by the malware as well. It is possible that the attacks may constitute an act of war due to the business of some of the targets. The malware has previously been used in widespread attacks against financial and research centers. It appears to be an espionage and reconnaissance tool. While it did not have direct access to nuclear power control networks, it could have be used to gather the information necessary to access those networks.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmgartner%2Fpg_flame/1/0100016e2147edd4-c2ece043-20ae-48c4-9950-9b7c29c6597b-000000/tXlevYI_JSthLqgmgZM-72U8BtW7Kg-KUWxmdvlQBps=113" target="_blank">pg_flame (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">pg_flame is a flamegraph generator for Postgres' EXPLAIN ANALYZE output.

The campaign owner responded to Musk's pledge by praising him as 'Treelon Musk', which prompted the name change. Musk's name change has already spawned memes on Reddit and other social media. He is known for his unpredictable Twitter presence where he has previously revealed breaking news about his companies, clashed with high-profile figures, and made statements that have landed him in trouble with shareholders and government agencies. The #TeamTrees campaign has attracted attention from other prominent figures besides Musk. However, Musk's donation is by far the largest so far.</p> <br><br>
