SpaceX was  conducting some pressure tests with the vehicle. The explosions were not completely unexpected, according to SpaceX. There were no injuries and the incident is not a serious setback for the Starship project. Starship will transport cargo and people to deep space destinations like the Moon and Mars. Elon Musk planned to test the vehicle in low altitudes within the next couple of months. A new prototype of the vehicle has been planned that has a different flight design to the prototype that burst.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.sciencealert.com%2Fphysicists-claim-a-they-ve-found-even-more-evidence-of-a-new-force-of-nature/1/0100016e8da8dab3-62e4a9ac-4045-49f7-9135-a55bae06aa8f-000000/BZSxbjTI0xkKgZBrDN2xshDe2Hj9OONP825KMhKcWhk=116" target="_blank">Physicists Claim They've Found Even More Evidence of a New Force of Nature (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The four known fundamental forces in our Universe are gravity, electromagnetism, and two nuclear interactions. Physicists may have observed a fifth physical force emerging from a helium atom. If its existence is confirmed, it could help scientists solve the dark matter problem. The force was first discovered after an anomaly was observed in the way beryllium-8 emits light as it decays. The direction that the energy moved was inconsistent with the law of conservation of energy. In order for this to be possible, a new kind of fundamental boson had to be involved. While the particle still hasn't been observed, experiments have shown that it is very likely it exists. The latest study has yet to be peer-reviewed, and many experiments will still need to be conducted to confirm the existence of X17.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fengineering.shopify.com%2Fblogs%2Fengineering%2Fsuccessfully-merging-work-1000-developers/1/0100016e8da8dab3-62e4a9ac-4045-49f7-9135-a55bae06aa8f-000000/VftqftTC1faXP9yMk7HLxu_L71jmHPOz5bhBCVlaQc4=116" target="_blank">Successfully Merging the Work of 1000+ Developers (9 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Shopify changes 40 times a day. It uses a trunk-based development workflow and around 400 commits to master are merged daily. There are many challenges with collaborating with a large team of over 1,000 developers. To solve these issues, Shopify upgraded its Merge Queue tool so it integrates with GitHub, runs continuous integration (CI) before merging to master, removes pull requests that failed CI, and maximizes deployment throughput of pull requests. Masters must always be passing CI, stay close to production, and emergency merges must be fast. By upgrading its tools and integrating these rules, Shopify was able to overcome their issues with scaling.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCoatiSoftware%2FSourcetrail/1/0100016e8da8dab3-62e4a9ac-4045-49f7-9135-a55bae06aa8f-000000/tF5Qh09eSZLyZ9zIqKQe88wbj6ihiwlYu6zdPJVRI1U=116" target="_blank">Sourcetrail (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Sourcetrail is an open-source cross-platform source explorer that helps developers become productive with unfamiliar source code. It indexes code and gathers data about its structure, then it provides a simple interface that allows developers to search code, display the structure of the source code, and view the source locations of currently selected code snippets. It supports C, C++, Java, and Python. Sourcetrail can be connected to many popular IDEs.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F11%2F20%2F20972692%2Fgoogle-earth-make-tours-favorite-travel-spots/1/0100016e8da8dab3-62e4a9ac-4045-49f7-9135-a55bae06aa8f-000000/BKgficq6kqET90Zv4XjJrkcxZbNck1C5UUsQZWqzp8c=116" target="_blank">You can now make tours in Google Earth to show your friends your favorite travel spots (1 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Google has added new tools to Google Earth that allows users to build personalized tours of areas right on top of the Google Earth map.
