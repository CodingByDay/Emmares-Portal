<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I have had fun recently joking about the number 666, which has recurred. For another devilish number, take Halloween. it was on Oct. 31, 2007, that world markets peaked before beginning the long descent that would turn into panic after the Lehman bankruptcy the following year. At the time of writing, FTSE’s all-world index is back to where it was on Halloween 2007. As far as the stock market is concerned, the world’s publicly quoted companies are worth no more now than they were more than 12 years ago.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">As for the European markets, the FTSE-Eurofirst 300 index is back to a level it first hit exactly 22 years ago, on March 12, 1998. Japanese stocks are still far from their peak on New Year’s Eve in 1989. These are sweeping and negative judgments by stock markets. In due course, that should be a positive — but perhaps not just yet. Today, after all, is Friday the 13th.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">This is the fastest descent from an all-time high on record. The two big exogenous shocks, from the oil price and the coronavirus, make this different from any other stock market crash, but there are still plenty of similarities. The chart below compares the fall from the Feb. 19 peak to the decline from the pre-Black Monday high in 1987, and to the drop from the weekend of the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008. The last example starts when the market was already down a lot, but Lehman was perceived at the time to change everything, and the market behaved similarly to 1987:</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Sell-offs this violent generally have some big bounces along the way, as we have seen. Having embarked on such a descent, we can expect to fall further. In terms of time, if not of distance, however, when markets move this quickly they usually finish their adjustment in short order. In general, stock markets spend most of their time climbing slowly, punctuated by sharp corrections. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">If 1987 and Lehman are templates, we shouldn’t expect stocks to be trading much higher a year from now. Don’t expect to return to the Feb. 19 summit soon, either. This chart, sent to me by Kambiz Kazemi, shows that after drawdowns of more than 20%, we should expect to wait at least six months before getting back to the top, and probably longer. The fastest recovery on record, in 1982, came under conditions that could scarcely be more different from today’s, as Paul Volcker raised rates to stamp out inflation.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Two weeks ago, it was stunning to see that 10-year Treasury yields might conceivably fall below 1% for the first time ever. Since then, they have reached almost 0.3%, and then recovered a lot. That means someone must be selling Treasuries. Who? And why? In combination with the historic sell-off in stocks, it seems baffling. Weird goings-on in other assets that are normally havens deepen the mystery. Bloomberg’s index of precious metals is down for the year. Bitcoin’s price halved this week. </p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">On the face of it, sales of haven assets imply that some big players must be in trouble. That means they are willing to resort to selling anything they can, particularly if it realizes a profit. Rumors are rife. But if a large leveraged institution is in trouble, it could take the market mess to a new and far more dangerous level. If it is an unlevered sovereign wealth fund, that’s still alarming.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">How far could we fall? The sell-off started with exogenous shocks, but the effect they have depends on the amount of leverage in the system (I, and many others, worry that excessive leverage in banks and households at the last crisis has merely been moved to governments and corporations in time for this one), and also on the degree of over-valuation. Stock markets outside the U.S. don’t look hugely expensive. The U.S. on the other hand looks alarmingly pricey compared to history.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The cyclically adjusted price-earnings, or CAPE, multiples kept by Robert Shiller of Yale University are an influential gauge of valuation, and they have persistently shown the market to be dangerously expensive over the last decade. As luck would have it, Shiller updated his series after the market closed Thursday. Here is the latest reading:</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The market looks much less richly valued after this sell-off. But it still looks very expensive. It is barely any lower than it was at the peak of the bull market in 1966, for example, before the long bear market of the 1970s. And the evidence is that bear markets have tended to end at much lower levels. To get back to the 2009 lows implies a fall of about 40% from here. To return to 1982’s lows requires a further 75% decline. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Against that, bond yields offer stronger support than at any time in history. But there is still not much solace in valuations. Once started on a course of unwinding, there could be much further to go. </p>

He cannot control the Dow Industrials. Further, he took office at a time when stocks looked historically expensive, and it was always a good bet that a big correction would happen at some point in his first term.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Since then, markets have had the chance to respond to the president’s critically panned broadcast from the White House on Wednesday evening, with the results we have witnessed. That has left Trump’s returns only 7th out of the 10 presidents to be elected for a first term since the war, at this point in their presidency. A month ago, Trump was in a virtual dead heat with Bill Clinton; now he has dropped behind Ronald Reagan, and his returns look poor.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">To ram home how silly his boasts were, and to show that it is possible for a president to win reelection without a booming stock market (something that could very easily still happen to Trump) note that his returns remain better than those or Richard Nixon and George W. Bush, both Republicans who won a second term. But having made such a big deal of the stock market on the way up, this crash will still do him some political damage. The way to bolster the stock market, and his political chances, is to provide the strong leadership in the fight against the virus that many still feel to be lacking.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">There have been plenty of poor communications by central bankers over the years. The unscripted comment by Christine Lagarde, the veteran French politician now head of the European Central Bank, that it wasn’t her job to narrow spreads between the sovereign bond yields of countries at the periphery of the euro zone and those at the center, was one of the worst on record. It immediately led to a huge sell-off in Italian bonds, at a time when that country had no shortage of things to worry about.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">To add to the Lagarde gaffe, which she tried to walk back within the hour, investors were disappointed that the ECB hadn’t fired even more money at the problem. They had also hoped that Lagarde would be able to corral European finance ministers into agreeing an effective fiscal package. It didn’t happen.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">It is in the euro zone that this year’s shocks have move furthest toward creating a true financial crisis. Euro-zone banks’ shares are their lowest, and trade at their steepest discount to book value, since the currency area’s inception. </p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Finally, let’s be clear that wrapping this in a bow of rationality wouldn’t be accurate. The stock market made its high less than a month ago, when there were already 75,000 coronavirus cases. On the face of it, this took stunning complacency, combined with a belief that Covid-19 would remain an Asian problem. Any problem seems greater when it is close to you, and can be easily dismissed when it is laying waste a city you have never heard of on the other side of the world. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">This week, the virus has afflicted a number of household-name athletes across the Western world, and even Tom Hanks. The huge Thursday sell-off came amid an industry still centered on New York on a day when New Yorkers learned that they were not to gather in groups of more than 500, that Broadway theaters would be closed, and the basketball season had been cancelled. Investors could live with a virus in Wuhan, but not in their own backyard. Just as it is only human to want to weave loose ends into a story, it is also only too human to ignore something that appears distant, and overreact when it suddenly gets too close for comfort. </p>
