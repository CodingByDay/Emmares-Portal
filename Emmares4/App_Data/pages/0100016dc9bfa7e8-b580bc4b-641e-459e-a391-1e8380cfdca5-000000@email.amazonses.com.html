The discovery could lead to new methods of repairing joint tissues as well as the possibility of growing new limbs. In order to make the discovery, scientists developed a method of measuring the age of proteins and found that cartilage was older as it moved up the human body. Cartilage is young in the ankles, middle-aged in the knees, and oldest in the hips. The position of the cartilage are correlated with how animals regenerate limbs. Limb repair is moderated by microRNA in animals. MicroRNA is also found in humans, and the scientists believe that they can use it to create medicines for treating joints.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Ftechnology%2Ffacial-recognition-london-pub-lineup-1.5317769/1/0100016dc9bfa7e8-b580bc4b-641e-459e-a391-1e8380cfdca5-000000/Ax6j49-k1YTxEfzJKJMAmsCoi1mWFKx9SBtUBRK5QZs=110" target="_blank">Getting scanned for a pint: How facial recognition technology is being used in a London pub (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A pub in England is using facial recognition technology to form a digital queue to prevent people from cutting in line. A display in the pub shows the crowd and a virtual number showing their place in the queue. Bartenders control the queue with tablets. The bar claims that the data never leaves the building and is deleted once it has been used, but some people are concerned that hackers may be able to access the data. Facial recognition technology is not regulated, so people need to be careful sometimes. The technology is also able to detect if someone is underage. </p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fpytorch.org%2Ftutorials%2Fbeginner%2Fdeep_learning_60min_blitz.html/1/0100016dc9bfa7e8-b580bc4b-641e-459e-a391-1e8380cfdca5-000000/Z1Weclf6_EgoA4UO6uekTv4o6N4vWY2S5sqZW6L280w=110" target="_blank">DEEP LEARNING WITH PYTORCH: A 60 MINUTE BLITZ (Website)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">This tutorial aims to give the student an understanding of Pytorch's Tensor library and neural networks at a high level.

(Hacker News Thread)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">An engineer at a startup that is planning an exit asks others for experiences for how their workplaces changed after other startups either sold via IPOs or changed ownership in other ways. In general, employees saw productivity in the company drop as people focused less on working and more on the potential money coming in. They planned more for their futures and had less urgency in developing products. Some companies had slower transitions, but eventually, they all saw a similar drop in productivity until the sale and transitions were complete and new management was installed. </p> <br><br> <p style="font-size: 16px;">If you have any feedback or would like to sponsor TLDR,&nbsp;please let me know by replying to this email!</p> <p style="font-size: 16px;">If you don't want to&nbsp;receive future editions of TLDR, <a href="http://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/http:%2F%2Factions.tldrnewsletter.com%2F .</p> </div> <img alt="" src="http://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CI0/0100016dc9bfa7e8-b580bc4b-641e-459e-a391-1e8380cfdca5-000000/zEqvd3OR2CWxtbC_lnV1KTXlXNdlqlN1bpirc85CoO0=110" style="display: none; width: 1px; height: 1px;">
