It is full of the bankerly evasion I have come to expect from these stories:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">

</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Michael Klein’s firm was one of several financial advisers that Aramco selected to help it deal with the IPO bankers, to oversee them and make sure they were doing a good job and working in Aramco’s interests. You might think that honesty about valuation would be an important part of working in Aramco’s interests, but nope! In fact, among the group of bankers working on the deal, talking to the client about valuation was so forbidden that:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Jonathan Penkin, a senior equity capital markets banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was told not to speak at any more meetings after he tried to talk about the valuation later in October, according to people familiar with the discussions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Disclosure, I used to be a (junior) equity capital markets banker at Goldman. I do not specifically recall being told not to speak at any more meetings but it does sound like the sort of thing that might have happened to me.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Anyway, as we’ve discussed, the basic problem was that Aramco wanted a $2 trillion valuation, its bankers—when they were jockeying for the mandate—said or at least strongly implied that that would be achievable, they went out and marketed to international investors, and the investors all came back and said no, absolutely not, we’ll give you like $1.2 trillion tops. And the bankers tried not to relay that feedback to Aramco, and then they finally had to, and Aramco’s bosses got very angry, pulled the international IPO, and did a “friends and family” IPO in which shares were sold to “local retail investors, rich Saudis and regional governments.” “The government would pressure wealthy local families, many of whom had members locked up in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton in 2017,” to buy some shares, and if you’re one of those families and declined that invitation you might find Prince Abdulaziz’s warning about hospitalization a little ominous. (Speaking of ominous: “An unsuccessful attempt was even made to persuade Qatar – under economic blockade by Riyadh – to make a large investment.”)</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I will say that I find Aramco’s approach here … kind of plausible? I laid out my basic theory of Aramco <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMTgvYXJhbWNvLXMtaXBvLWlzLWp1c3QtZm9yLXByYWN0aWNl/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B436e8895" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="Q16CPL6KLVRH" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">last month</a>, though it’s so basic that it hardly deserves to be called a theory: If Aramco goes public and trades at a $2 trillion valuation, then that’s a pretty good argument that it deserves a $2 trillion valuation. It’s not an <em>airtight</em> argument, and all of the objections that investors had to this IPO—the relatively low dividend yield compared to peers, the lack of transparency, the geopolitical risk, the fact that “nobody at Aramco could convincingly explain why Aramco deserved its $2 trillion valuation”—will still apply even if Aramco trades up to $2 trillion on a tiny float in a friendly local market.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">But offering a tiny float in a friendly local market is a pretty good way to get the stock to trade up, and there will be <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxOS8xMi8xMS9idXNpbmVzcy9zYXVkaS1hcmFtY28taXBvLXN0b2NrLmh0bWw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B9b2a26b6" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">other positive pressure</a>:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Analysts say that in the short term, investors with buy orders for Aramco shares may find few sellers. Saudi small investors will be rewarded for holding the shares for six months, earning a bonus share for each 10 that they buy, up to a ceiling of 100 bonus shares, so they are unlikely to bail out soon.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">“It is not obvious who is going to be selling,” said Zachary Cefaratti, chief executive of Dalma Capital, a Dubai-based financial firm with three funds focused on Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">At the same time, Mr. Cefaratti said, fund managers who follow certain stock indexes would be under pressure to buy Aramco shares. MSCI, an index provider, for instance, plans to include Aramco in several stock indexes beginning Tuesday. An adviser on the I.P.O. estimated that such pressures could create $3 billion to $5 billion of new demand for the shares.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">There’s price-insensitive demand, there is an artificial lack of supply, it’s a good recipe to get to the valuation they want. And then they can go back to international investors—as they are <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zYXVkaS1hcmFtY28tc291bmRzLW91dC1pbnZlc3RvcnMtb24tZnJlc2gtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1pcG8tMTE1NzYwMDQ2NzI_bW9kPWl0cF93c2omcnU9eWFob28/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B28142fa6" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">apparently contemplating</a>—and say “see, it’s worth $2 trillion, don’t you want in now?” And maybe the international investors say no—maybe they have conviction on their valuation calls and won’t pay more than it’s worth—but maybe they say yes. Maybe peer pressure and fear of missing out on a hot stock will work in Aramco’s favor, the way peer pressure and fear of catching a falling knife seem to have worked against Aramco in this round. If nobody’s paying more than $1.2 trillion for Aramco, it’s easy to refuse to pay more than $1.2 trillion for Aramco. Once it’s trading at $2 trillion—even debatably, even artificially—then it’s easier to say yes.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">We <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMTAtMjUvZXh4b24taXMtaW4tdHJvdWJsZS1vdmVyLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdl/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Ba1bc9303" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="PH5SS96JIJUS" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">talked about this case last year, and</a> I found the attorney general’s complaint more compelling than I expected to. But it was always a strange case. The gist of it was that Exxon told investors that it evaluated oil and gas projects using a “proxy cost” of carbon emissions to account for the risk of climate change and increasing regulation, but in fact it frequently based its investing decisions on the current costs and the existing regulatory environment rather than using the higher hypothetical proxy costs.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">This is an odd theory in part because it is weird to expect a company to use <em>imaginary </em>costs in evaluating projects. Not <em>that </em>weird, fine, just because Exxon said that it would do it, but still weird. If regulators want oil companies to internalize the cost of carbon emissions, the regulators can impose carbon taxes or restrictions, which will raise the cost of oil production. But if the regulators <em>don’t </em>impose those taxes, then it is strange to ask oil companies to <em>pretend that they had</em>, and to act as though the cost of oil production was higher than it is. In <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFuZG9kaWFyeS5jb20vd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzL3NpdGVzLzI2NS8yMDE5LzEyL0V4eG9uTW9iaWwtb3Bpbmlvbi5wZGY/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B9c5d341e" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">the judge’s decision</a>, he quotes former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson’s testimony that Exxon “very explicitly gives to the local organization — in fact, we encourage the local organization to go become informed about your regulatory environment; particularly, on projects where it could be important, and use your best assessment of what is this investment really going to experience over its life.” That kind of sounds like better management than “we make up one general assumption for the all-in cost of future regulation all over the world, and then make every project manager use it.” Telling your employees to understand reality and react to it is a good idea! It’s hard to see how it can be securities fraud.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The attorney general’s theory is also not quite <em>true</em>. It seems to rest on a sort of accounting mistake. In modeling projects, Exxon’s managers sometimes used cost assumptions that were based on current reality rather than on its proxy costs. But the proxy costs were developed by Exxon’s corporate strategy group not to project <em>the costs of projects</em>, but to project <em>oil prices</em>: The idea is that proxy costs would lower the demand for oil and thus the assumed price of oil. Estimating the costs of projects was a separate job. You estimate the cost of projects (using actual or estimated costs), you estimate their payoffs (using a projected oil price that takes into account the proxy costs), and then you do the project if the payoffs are bigger than the costs. So you <em>are </em>using the proxy costs. The judge writes:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">ExxonMobil’s simple rejoinder is that these internal models <em>did </em>include proxy costs of carbon. For example, Robert Bailes testified that “[T]he price bases for oil and gas are established from our <em>Outlook </em>on global demand and global energy supply sources. So, that [proxy costs of carbon] gets baked in, okay, to investment proposals.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The other strange thing about the attorney general’s theory is the underlying strangeness of treating climate change as primarily a matter of <em>defrauding shareholders</em>. We talk about this a lot, and my general view is that regulators like to treat everything as securities fraud because it tends to be easier to prove, and to punish, than whatever the underlying substantive problem is. So, here, state attorneys general have more tools to fight securities fraud than climate change, so they have incentives to recast climate-change disputes as securities-fraud disputes.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">But calling everything securities fraud doesn’t <em>only </em>make things easier for regulators. It also introduces some new requirements. Particularly, you have to prove that investors care. It’s only securities fraud if the misrepresentations were material to investors, and here there's a decent argument that they weren’t. The attorney general spent a lot of time on some 2014 Exxon reports that laid out a lot of its (allegedly false) climate-change methodology, but never proved that anyone read them:</p>

</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">This is fitting. When we first talked about this case in 2015, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTUtMTEtMDYvZXh4b24tbWlnaHQtYmUtaW4tdHJvdWJsZS1vdmVyLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdl/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B486fb5d3" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="NXF2XF6KLVR8" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">I wrote</a> that “if you actually think that Exxon Mobil is engaged in a diabolical conspiracy to suppress climate science to wring extra profits out of an earth-destroying business, the <em>last </em>people you should be worried about are Exxon's <em>shareholders</em>. They’re the ones profiting from all that destruction!” If you try to cast them as victims, you might run into the problem that they don’t actually care.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 21px; line-height: 28px; font-weight: bold; Margin-bottom: 18px; Margin-top: 18px">P(rinciples) Diddy</h2>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">It is time for a bit of radical transparency and searing self-examination here. I feel like basically my main job, here at this newsletter, is to find financial things that are funny and then articulate why they are funny. That is the thing that I do, the thing that I usually think I am good at. <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1TQ0NmazJhMk81bw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Ba476acd4" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Here is a funny financial thing</a>. It is a video of Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates LP and author of “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJpbmNpcGxlcy5jb20v/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B544eb229" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Principles</a>,” sitting down to mentor Sean “Diddy” Combs, founder of Bad Boy Entertainment and author of “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1sSG9rN1JxbUR2SQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115C28bf2afc" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">It’s All About the Benjamins</a>.” And words absolutely fail me. I cannot explain to you why this thing is so strange and so funny. Just, I don’t know, if you think you might appreciate that sort of thing, it’s even better than you think, go watch it.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">At around the 3:20 mark Dalio tells Diddy that he should figure out what he’s not good at and then hire people who are good at those things to do them for him. That is surely the very first thing they teach you in zillionaire school, and Diddy has spent the last quarter-century <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18867924.138717/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQmFkX0JveV9SZWNvcmRz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bd1d3d5f3" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">running a successful company</a> whose core business is spotting talent, but when Dalio says it he <em>writes it down </em>in his evidently highlighted copy of “Principles.” What? Why?</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Actually a running theme of the whole mentorship is that if you are really rich you should hire people to do stuff for you, which, one, yes, fair, but, two, it kind of reduces the general applicability of Dalio’s advice? “Whatever impediments you have,” Dalio says around 13:15, “you can get the best talent in the world to do that with you, and it doesn’t take any real time, it doesn’t cost you hardly anything compared to the cost of wasting your time.” The talents and labor of others: basically free! That’s surely true for Dalio, and probably for Diddy, but for most people “you have so much money that you can pay the best people in the world to satisfy your every whim and you’ll hardly even notice the cost” is not actually accurate advice! </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em"><em>I </em>found this conversation educational, but I can’t really believe that Diddy did. The thing that I mostly thought, watching this video, was just, <em>why do these people have time for this? </em>Aren’t they <em>busy</em>? Don’t they have businesses to run or yachts to sunbathe on? What do they <em>get </em>out of this? Surely it is not just tips on how to hire help. Surely it is branding and cross-promotion: Dalio gets to be the sort of hedge-fund billionaire who hangs out with rap moguls; Diddy gets to be the sort of rap mogul who hangs out with hedge-fund billionaires. If you’re successful enough, the real payoff is not that you can hire talented people for relative peanuts to do work for you; the real payoff is that you can get <em>really </em>talented people to further your success <em>for free</em>, because you’re doing the same for them. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The other deep message of the video—a message that seems to be very popular among a certain sort of hedge fund manager—is that success is universalizable: If you are wildly successful in one sphere of activity, you get to waltz into everything else and people will immediately take you seriously. If you build the world’s largest hedge fund you can <em>show up at Diddy’s house and tell him how to run his life </em>and he will nod appreciatively and take notes.</p>
