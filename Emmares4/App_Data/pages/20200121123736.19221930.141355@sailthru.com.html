<h2 style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial Black, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -1px; border-bottom: 1px dotted #000000; padding-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 20px">Who controls a company?</h2>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Here is a magical corporate ownership structure. Bremer Financial Corp. is a bank holding company in Minnesota; it owns a bank, Bremer Bank, with about $13 billion of assets.[1] Bremer Bank was founded by Otto Bremer, “an American success story, a German immigrant who moved to Minnesota in 1886 and built a thriving regional banking business.”[2] He was the only shareholder of the bank until 1944, when he started the Otto Bremer Trust, a charitable foundation, and gave it some of his shares. Otto Bremer died in 1951, leaving the trust as the bank’s sole shareholder. The trust “has contributed over $700 million to charitable causes in the Upper Midwest” over the years, funded basically by dividends from the bank.[3]</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">It’s a little weird, and disfavored by modern tax law, to have a for-profit company controlled by a charitable trust, and so in 1989 the bank was reorganized to end the trust’s voting control. There are now two classes of shares: Class A shares, which vote, and Class B shares, which mostly don’t. The trust kept 92% of the economic ownership of the bank in the form of 10.8 million Class B shares (90% of the total capital) and 240,000 out of 1.2 million Class A shares (2% of the capital and 20% of the votes); it sold the other “80 percent of the Class A shares to Bremer employees and directors and the Company’s employee stock-ownership plan and profit-sharing plan.” (It is still not publicly listed.) The bank’s board of directors consists of the three trustees of the trust, plus seven other directors elected by the employee-shareholders.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">A lot of companies have dual-class stock in which the founding/controlling shareholder owns high-vote shares and the regular shareholders own low-vote shares. This is the reverse: The founding/controlling shareholder (the trust) owns no-vote shares; the regular shareholders own the voting shares. Normal dual-class structures often have a provision that, if the founder sells the high-vote shares to an outsider, they convert into low-vote shares: The goal of the structure is to preserve the <em>founder’s </em>voting rights, not to let the founder sell those rights for money. The Bremer structure does something similar: If the trust sells its no-vote shares to an outsider, the outsider can convert them into voting shares. The goal of the structure is to comply with tax law, not to render the shares permanently non-voting. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">So the trust owns 92% of the stock but has only 20% of the vote. But if it sold a bit more than 6% of the stock to a friend, it would own 86% of the stock, its friend would own 6%, and the trust and the friend would combine for about 50.1% of the vote.[4]</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I am tempted to stop here. That’s everything important in the story; I have given you the general layout of the problem, and in the previous paragraph I have explained the mechanism that gets things moving. You can fill in the details however you like and you’ll get a pretty good corporate governance puzzle.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But I guess I will sketch what actually happened. The trust decided that the bank should be sold, for cash, to a larger bank. The reasons for this are disputed and interesting but not especially relevant for my purposes; I am tempted to sum them up by saying “interest rates are too low for the current structure to continue.”[5] The board—I mean, the seven directors who are not also trustees of the trust—would prefer not to sell. Again their reasons are not especially important; generically I will say that (1) often directors and managers of companies, who tend to have well-paid and prestigious gigs, would prefer not to sell their companies to big acquirers and lose their positions; (2) often they will say that they are refusing to sell out of a commitment to long-term value and a concern for employees, communities and other stakeholders; and (3) sometimes that will be true. (I’d note that the non-trust directors here really do represent employee-owners, more than is the case in normal public companies.)</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">So the board said no to a sale, the trust hired financial advisers anyway, the advisers found another bank that made a non-binding bid for Bremer, the board turned down the bid, the trust got annoyed, and it did the obvious thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Infuriated by the Board’s decision not to sell the Company, the Trustees began pursuing unilateral action to remove the disinterested directors from the Board. As noted, Lipschultz [a trustee] had repeatedly threatened to sell the Trust’s Class B nonvoting shares to a third party who would convert them into a controlling block of Class A voting shares and effect a whole-company acquisition. But the Trustees and KBW [the trust’s financial adviser] evidently could not find a buyer for all the Trust’s shares. No one would make such a large investment without the Company’s cooperation, which the Board had resolved not to provide. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Accordingly, the Trustees conceived of a new plan. Instead of one buyer for all the Trust’s shares, they canvassed the market for multiple entities each willing to buy a smaller number of shares. If they could find enough friendly buyers of Class B shares, the Trustees could assemble a coalition with enough voting power, acting in concert, to remove the Board’s disinterested directors and force through a sale themselves.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">That is exactly what the Trustees have now purported to do. On October 28, 2019, the Trustees sent a letter to Bremer’s Board, attached hereto as Exhibit E, which stated that “on October 25, 2019, [the Trust] sold approximately seven percent of [Bremer’s] Class B common stock to a number of investors in separate, independent transactions.” The Trustees asserted that they had orchestrated this attack on Bremer—the Company they purport to serve as fiduciaries— because they believed it was in the best interests of the Trust. The Trustees also sent a purported “Stock Transfer Notification” asserting that the Trustees had transferred 725,000 Class B shares to 19 entities, primarily small hedge funds such as “Financial Hybrid Opportunity SPV,” “Malta Offshore Fund,” and “Banc Fund X.” …</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Nearly simultaneously, these 19 entities wrote to Bremer purportedly electing to convert their Class B shares into Class A shares. If each of these purported transfers and subsequent conversions were valid, then the 19 entities and the Trust would collectively own 50.13 percent of Bremer’s voting power. </p>

It is hard to think of a more stakeholder-governed company than Bremer Bank. Its main shareholder is a charity; its board represents employee-owners; its mission is to serve the community; the state’s courts and attorney general, as overseers of charities, get to sign off on its decisions. And they are all at each others’ throats. There are no rapacious hedge funds or amoral index funds in sight, or there weren’t anyway until the charity got frustrated and brought in some hedge funds to help it out.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The point here is not exactly “stakeholders can disagree just like shareholders can.” The point is really that stakeholders have <em>more </em>ways to disagree than shareholders do. The criterion of maximizing shareholder value is not necessarily socially optimal, and it is not necessarily clear what it requires; shareholders and executives regularly disagree about whether a strategic change or a stock buyback or a merger or whatever would increase shareholder value. But their arguments, at least in theory, appeal to the same criterion. If you’re choosing between providing more money for charity, on the one hand, and running a bank with strong employee rights and community ties, on the other hand, how do you decide? The answer might be that you have some people who care about the charity money, and other people who care about the workers, and you put them on a board together and hope they can work it out, and sometimes they do, and sometimes they all sue each other instead.</p>

Hmm! </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I don’t know what public information you would have used, on Sunday evening, to conclude that Amy Klobuchar was much more likely to receive the Times endorsement than she had been a few hours earlier. Like maybe you could have read some position papers on her website and said “hmm this sounds like stuff the Times would like,” or you could have read the transcript of <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19221930.141355/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMC8wMS8xNS9vcGluaW9uL2FteS1rbG9idWNoYXItbnl0aW1lcy1pbnRlcnZpZXcuaHRtbA/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B8a94d606" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">her interview with the Times</a>, but you could have done that last week too; none of that was new on Sunday evening. If you assume that the market had efficiently incorporated all public information about Klobuchar's chances of getting the Times’s endorsement as of Sunday morning, there was not much reason for those chances to rise dramatically over the course of Sunday evening, unless the rise was based on <em>non-</em>public information. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But part of the standard justification for prediction markets is exactly that they <em>will</em> be informed by insider trading. The idea of political prediction markets is that campaign aides and party insiders and other informed people will place bets and move the prices in line with real informed probabilities and thus provide information to the public. The point is not just to allow you to have fun making uninformed bets on the candidates you like; the point is to provide the public with information about politics. Providing a fair game for gambling addicts to bet on democracy is just not that important a public interest; providing a more scientific and reliable way to forecast elections, maybe, is.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The most reliable theory is one of misappropriation: If you work for an entity involved in a market, you probably shouldn’t trade on your inside knowledge of what the entity is going to do. If you’re a trader at an oil company, don’t front-run your company’s trades in your personal account. But if you <em>are </em>the entity the rules are less clear. If you're a public company, you can’t buy your own stock based on private information, and there are disclosure rules and blackout periods to accommodate that. But if you're an oil company you sure can trade oil based on your proprietary information.

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Airbus SE is developing a derivatives-based trading platform that will allow airlines to protect against declines in ticket prices -- and potentially help sustain growth and jet orders.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Clients of the Skytra subsidiary will trade futures and options on a series of indexes that capture fare fluctuations across the industry. The venture is the brainchild of two Airbus veterans and emerged from a workshop with a struggling airline. …</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Airbus says the mechanism will help airlines to insulate against the impact of reduced demand or increased seat supply, just as they already hedge against currency and oil-price movements. On the flip side, businesses whose staff regularly fly could use it to protect against rising fares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I mean obviously the airlines will insider trade that! What else<em> could</em> they do? The point of this market is to let airlines, which set ticket prices, bet on future ticket prices. The airlines will have more information about their ticket-pricing plans than, you know, the “businesses whose staff regularly fly” will. Of course the businesses will have information about their own demand that the airlines won’t have. It is a market for people with proprietary information to trade with each other. I know that you have proprietary information that I don’t have, but that’s okay because I have proprietary information that you don’t have. If you <em>don’t</em> have any proprietary information, and you trade anyway, and you lose money, you can’t really complain. You have misunderstood the point of the whole market. </p>

If an airline sells a ticket to a drug trafficker, or a Starbucks sells a terrorist a coffee, or Ferrari sells a corrupt official a car, they don’t get in trouble; it is not <em>generally </em>expected that most businesses will inquire into the identity of their customers and only serve upstanding law-abiding citizens.

White explains that there are actually “many Davoses at Davos,” not just official events in which the world’s rich and powerful perform their power, but also secret events where they secretly exercise it: </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">And then there is the hidden Davos: the private, off-the-record events organized by the World Economic Forum. These secretive invite-only meetings are held under the Chatham House rule, a strict guideline that protects the anonymity of participants in order to facilitate frank discussion. These, along with the equally confidential bilateral meetings held between participants in corridors and hotel lobbies, is the Davos with the potential to usher in great social changes.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">In the hidden Davos opposing social forces, activists and elites, can put their egos and personas aside to speak freely and find common cause for joint action on the global crises that impact us all – from income inequality to climate change. It is here that the argument can be made that elites must stop suppressing protest and instead harness the creative energy of social movements to achieve great changes. The Forum is perhaps the only place on earth where these opportunities for fraternization are possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Ah. The secretive invite-only meetings at Davos are where people put their egos aside. I am going to meditate on that for a while. What if it’s true? What if those meetings are the end point of human striving? What if people devote their lives to the pursuit of wealth and power and fame and prestige until one day they finally reach the culmination of being invited to secret meetings at Davos, and then they can rest, they have won, they can put their egos aside, they have found peace at last? It is something to aspire to, maybe, I guess, I don’t know.</p>

<em>[4] More accurately, if the trust sold 725,000 shares of Class B stock (about 6.04% of the 12 million total shares), and the buyer converted those shares into Class A shares, then there would be a total of 1,925,000 Class A shares, the trust would own 240,000 of them (as it does now), the buyer would own 725,000 of them, and those 965,000 Class A shares would combine to be 50.13% of the 1,925,000 shares, slightly outvoting the 960,000 Class A shares held by the employees and directors and so forth. Meanwhile the trust would still have 10,075,000 Class B shares, or about 83.96% of the total capital, as well as its 240,000 Class A shares (2%).

<em>[5] Bremer Financial was approached last year by another bank about a merger. That didn’t go anywhere. But after that approach, the trust did some valuation work and concluded that the bank was worth <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19221930.141355/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFydHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbWlubmVzb3RhLWFnLWp1bXBzLWludG8tZmlnaHQtYmV0d2Vlbi1icmVtZXItYmFuay1hbmQtdGhlLWNoYXJpdHktdGhhdC1vd25zLWl0LzU2Njk1Mzc1Mi8_cmVmcmVzaD10cnVl/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Ccad593b5" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta itemprop="type" content="WebLink">around $2 billion</a>, roughly double the fair market value reported by the bank on its 2018 tax return (see paragraph 16 of <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19221930.141355/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJlbWVyZm9yd2FyZC5jb20vd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMTkvMTEvYnJlbWVyQ29tcGxhaW50LnBkZg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Ec745c048" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta itemprop="type" content="WebLink">the complaint</a>). Tax law requires the trust to pay out 5% of its assets each year, or about $100 million if you believe that valuation. The bank pays dividends of about $50 million a year to the trust, meaning that it can’t pay out $100 million out of dividends alone. The straightforward reading here is that in the olden days—when the trust was set up, when the tax law was put in place—a bank could yield 5% a year in dividends for its owners, and now it can’t: The valuation of this bank is significantly more than 20 times its dividend stream, so the structure doesn’t work. There are of course other considerations. Being a small bank is harder now, competitively, than it used to be. And the bank argues that the trustees have self-interested reasons for selling; it also disputes that their valuation is correct, or that there is really a tax need to sell, and it argues that it could always raise the dividend. But generically the trust’s argument is of the form “banks these days are worth more than 20 times the annual dividend they can pay,” which strikes me as plausible; tax law then makes it hard for charities to own those banks.</em>
