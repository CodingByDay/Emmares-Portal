Tesla says that its Autopilot system is only designed to assist drivers, and still requires drivers to pay attention and be ready to intervene. While the system may make driving safer, it does not mitigate all risks. The NHTSA has yet to issue any regulations on advanced driver assist systems.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fox13news.com%2Fnews%2Fupcoming-spacex-launch-to-be-first-supported-by-u-s-space-force/1/0100016f7a8cf58f-12e05517-24c3-44ef-be6b-a6658c2b8417-000000/naHTbv6t0TrCmpVD-HCRKlvrG-Q70NH_jw7iTD_asPo=122" target="_blank">Upcoming SpaceX launch to be first supported by U.S. Space Force (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The new US Space Force was created as the sixth branch of the military in December.

The Finnish government is a coalition of five parties, all with female leaders. Marin is calling for shorter work hours, saying that the Finns should have to work for only four days a week, for six hours per day. A five day a week, eight hour per day schedule is currently normal in Finland. A city in Sweden reduced working time to six hours a day in old people's homes and at the municipal hospital in 2015, and it resulted in happier, healthier, and more productive employees. Six-hour workdays are normal in Sweden's tech industry, where the schedule has proven to increase productivity, efficiency, and as a result, profitability.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid=21961560/1/0100016f7a8cf58f-12e05517-24c3-44ef-be6b-a6658c2b8417-000000/KATltoQPzqEeDdDplqn4L_LPsH-tu4pydJwt1Rl13xg=122" target="_blank">Ask HN: I've been slacking off at Google for 6 years.
