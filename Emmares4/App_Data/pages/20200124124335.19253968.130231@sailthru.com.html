<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One theory is that investment banks are the gatekeepers of the capital markets. Private companies that want to go public come to the investment banks for help, and the investment banks screen those companies and take public only the ones that they can vouch for. Big prestigious investment banks will be choosy with their endorsements; their endorsements will mean something. The stamp of approval of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs signifies that a private company is good, and the banks carefully guard their reputation for underwriting good companies. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The other theory is that initial public offerings pay large fees and the investment banks are in the business of collecting large fees. If a company wants to go public, it will interview banks, and the banks will compete to win the business by telling the company how great and valuable it is. Then the banks who win the business will advise the company on its IPO, and send the company’s prospectus to potential investors, and set up meetings with those investors on a roadshow, and take orders from investors who want to buy stock. And then banks will tell the company how much stock the investors want to buy and at what price, and the company will sell that stock. The banks are middlemen; they are managers of a process; they serve a coordinating and centralizing function. They don’t tell you that the company is good; they certainly don’t tell you how much it is worth. They are hired by the company to work for it. The people deciding how much the company is worth are <em>the investors</em>, large sophisticated professional money managers who decide to invest after reading a detailed prospectus and meeting with the company’s managers; they are free to put in orders at whatever price they like, or not to put in orders if the deal seems too rich. It is a free market, and if the market thinks the company is worth a lot of money then it is irrelevant what the bank thinks. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The truth is somewhere in between. Banks certainly vouch for <em>some aspects </em>of the companies that they take public. They do due diligence, they review the prospectus, they generally work to tell the company’s story in a flattering but truthful way. If the prospectus is full of lies, or if the company is an outright fraud, investors in the IPO will blame and probably sue the banks. But in general, within the limits of what is required by law, banks tend to take a pretty laissez-faire approach to underwriting. They don’t tell investors what they should buy, and they don’t tell companies how they should run their business. They just coordinate between the two.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">So for instance there is a lot of controversy over whether companies should have dual-class stock, in which the founders’ shares have more voting power than the shares sold to the public. Some investors think this is bad. They lobby various gatekeepers—<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTctMDgtMDEvaW5kZXgtcnVsZXMtYW5kLWFuYWx5c3QtZmF0aWd1ZQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B4f305b7b" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="OU0DLG6KLVR4" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">index</a> <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTctMDctMjcvdGhlLWVuZC1vZi1saWJvci1hbmQtbm9uLXZvdGluZy1zdG9jaw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Ba6df8579" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="OTR4HB6KLVRA" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">providers</a>, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDItMTIvbHlmdC1kb2Vzbi10LW5lZWQtaW52ZXN0b3JzLXRvLXZvdGU/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B98f84676" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="PMTOHH6JIJUO" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">stock exchanges</a>, the <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9uZXdzL3NwZWVjaC9wZXJwZXR1YWwtZHVhbC1jbGFzcy1zdG9jay1jYXNlLWFnYWluc3QtY29ycG9yYXRlLXJveWFsdHk/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bf994bc01" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>—to stop it, to forbid companies from going public (or listing on the exchange, or being included in indexes) if they have dual-class stock. These investors argue that dual-class stock is wrong, that it is bad for investors, that companies should not be governed that way. You could imagine an investment bank saying: Those investors are right, dual-class stock is bad, we have our reputation to consider, we will not underwrite IPOs with dual-class stock. If a company wants to go public with dual-class stock it can seek out some lesser investment bank, but we, the good investment bank, have standards, and we will not allow our reputation to be sullied by underwriting such a monstrosity.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But this never happens. Instead what happens is more like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0"><strong>Company: </strong>We want to go public with dual-class stock.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0"><strong>Bank:</strong> Well, as your adviser on how to go public, we should tell you that investors do not like that, and we recommend against it.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0"><strong>Company:</strong> Do you have any data to demonstrate that? Is there a list of recent IPOs that failed due to dual-class stock?</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0"><strong>Bank:</strong> Right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The bank probably <em>will</em> express to the company the market’s preference for best practices, but it will not <em>insist</em>. It will try to explain the tradeoffs and describe the risks honestly. There are some things that the market won’t put up with, and the bank will tell the company that it can’t go public if it does those things. But there are not many of those things; mostly, there are things that the market will complain about but accept at some price, and there are other things that the market will complain about but accept without even affecting the price. A bank that says “you can’t go public with dual-class stock, the market won’t buy it” would be lying to its client. A bank that says “you can go public with dual-class stock, but not with us, we are too good for that” would be an outlier, and would lose a lot of business.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">This was not always true, by the way. The vouching theory used to be pretty real. Steven Mandis, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment banker, wrote a book called “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.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" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" title="page 130" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">What Happened to Goldman Sachs</a>” that includes this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">When I joined Goldman, strict underwriting guidelines were in place for taking a company public. … Typically, Goldman would not take a company public if it had not been in business for three years, and it had to show profitability. But then came the technology and internet boom, and suddenly companies with little track record and no profits started being taken public by competitors. The requirement at Goldman was reduced to two years of profitability, then to one year, and then to one quarter, until finally the firm was not even requiring profitability in the foreseeable future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">(Disclosure: I also worked at Goldman, though long after the required-profitability days.) </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">You can <em>understand </em>this shift. In the olden days, only taking good companies public could have been a good commercial strategy: Perhaps investors only wanted profitable companies, or perhaps the investors were mostly individuals who needed to rely on banks to evaluate companies for them. In the internet boom of the late 1990s, investors started to <em>want</em> unprofitable companies; also investors became bigger and more institutional and relied less on banks to pick companies for them.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">A pristine reputation for underwriting good IPOs was once a valuable asset that could be monetized by renting it to carefully selected companies. Now a pristine reputation for underwriting good IPOs is <em>not </em>a particularly valuable asset. Investors will not stop doing business with a bank because it underwrote the IPO of a big money-losing unicorn—because investors <em>like </em>big money-losing unicorns, or they have short memories, or they just don’t expect banks to vouch for companies anymore. So refusing to underwrite unprofitable companies would cause a bank to lose business, but without any real gain on the other side. You couldn’t charge any more to underwrite the profitable companies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon issued the latest ultimatum Thursday from Davos. Wall Street's biggest underwriter of initial public offerings in the U.S. will no longer take a company public in the U.S. and Europe if it lacks a director who is either female or diverse. …</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">“Starting on July 1st in the U.S. and Europe, we’re not going to take a company public unless there's at least one diverse board candidate, with a focus on women,” Solomon told CNBC Thursday. He didn't mention Asia, which continues to lag behind other regions when it comes to board diversity. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Next year, the bank will raise the threshold to two diverse directors, Goldman said in a statement. The bank said the decision came after it learned more than 60 U.S. and European companies in the last two years went public without a woman or person of color on the board. Goldman Sachs has four women on its 11-member board. …</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">“We realize that this is a small step, but it’s a step in a direction of saying, ‘You know what, we think this is right, we think it’s the right advice and we’re in a position also, because of our network, to help our clients if they need help placing women on boards,’” Solomon told CNBC. “So this is an example of us saying, ‘How can we do something that we think is right and help moves the market forward?’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I mean I guess it’s a little weird because Goldman went public (in 1999) with an <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9mZWxpeHNhbG1vbi9zdGF0dXMvMTIyMDQ1NzYwNjA5NzExMzA4OD9zPTEx/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B40c8b23f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">all-male board</a>, or because Goldman has a pretty unbroken tradition of <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9ibWNsYW5uYWhhbi9zdGF0dXMvMTIyMDQwMTA2MzI0MjYyOTEyMQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B39a7086a" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">senior leadership by bald white men</a>. But it’s also weird because this sort of explicit absolute requirement is so unusual these days, such a “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9saXpyaG9mZm1hbi9zdGF0dXMvMTIyMDM3MzY4Nzc0MTk2MDE5Mg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B314cd91f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">throwback view of underwriting</a>,” as the Wall Street Journal’s Liz Hoffman tweeted.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One shouldn’t overstate the importance of this policy. “The corporate board has become a rare bright spot for gender and racial diversity at the highest echelons of corporate America,” and most companies that Goldman would otherwise consider taking public will either already have some board diversity or else be keenly embarrassed about that and looking to fix it before going public. Adding a board member is just <em>not that hard.</em> Meanwhile the policy doesn’t seem to apply in Asia, where it might otherwise cause Goldman to have to turn down some assignments. Goldman is not setting a high standard to push the market in a different direction. It is just codifying something that is pretty market standard anyway.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But that’s still something! There are lots of things that the market wants. Some of those things get codified in securities laws or stock-exchange listing standards or index eligibility methodologies. Some of them are not codified; investors just look for them informally, and underwriters informally tell companies that, if they want to go public, they should do those things. But they don’t usually get codified, publicly, <em>at banks. </em>Banks don’t usually write down and publicize explicit policies saying that they won’t take a company public unless it meets certain standards. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Now, a little bit, they do. It’s not just this policy at Goldman; some banks have also announced explicit policies of not underwriting companies that are in certain business lines (mainly <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taW5pbmcuY29tL2RldXRzY2hlLWJhbmstd29udC1maW5hbmNlLWFueS1jb2FsLXByb2plY3RzLWFueS1sb25nZXIv/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bdaf039de" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">mountaintop-removal coal mining</a>). But it does seem to open the door to other policies. “If underwriters are going to act as gatekeepers, then the bar should get raised across the board,” <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9saXpyaG9mZm1hbi9zdGF0dXMvMTIyMDM3MzY4Nzc0MTk2MDE5Mg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115C314cd91f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">tweeted Hoffman</a>. If Goldman’s one explicit underwriting standard is “you need to have a woman on your board,” then … why not have two underwriting standards? If you think there are other things that all companies should do, that are not currently required by law, why not push to have them required by Goldman?</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The dynamic here is not quite, I think, the old-fashioned one of banks preserving and monetizing their reputation for underwriting only solid upstanding companies. The dynamic behind Solomon announcing this not-especially-hard policy, on television, at Davos, is pretty straightforward: You can’t really go to Davos without announcing some tiny symbolic effort to make the world better, and this will get Goldman some nice press.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But the broader dynamic is that investors want things from companies, and in practice they often <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDItMTIvbHlmdC1kb2Vzbi10LW5lZWQtaW52ZXN0b3JzLXRvLXZvdGU/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115C98f84676" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="PMTOHH6JIJUO" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">demand those things through gatekeepers</a>: They push the SEC or the exchanges or the index providers to impose market standards that investors want. In loose disorganized ways they do the same thing with underwriters: When a company files to go public, and investors don’t like some feature of the IPO, they’ll call up the underwriters to try to change it, and the underwriters will aggregate that feedback and present it to the company. But they don’t generally lobby investment banks to add that feature to its global list of explicitly banned IPO features, because investment banks just don’t have those lists. But now Goldman does! It’s a list with one item, but it’s a list. If you don’t like dual-class stock, or whatever, you can call Goldman up and ask it to add dual-class stock to the list. If you’re a big powerful investor who does a lot of business with Goldman, they might even listen to you. </p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One reason that I tend to believe the underwriters-as-coordinators theory more than the underwriters-as-gatekeepers theory is that I know how IPO pitches go. A company doesn’t come in and try to impress the banks so that the banks will vouch for it; the banks come in and try to impress the company by telling it how great and valuable it is.

That goes into the financial statements, you know? You get a little bump in revenue and customer growth because of all those captive customers, the people buying your yoga pants not (necessarily) because they like the pants but because they want the IPO business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">When enterprise software companies are hiring banks to help them go public, they frequently want to hire firms that are customers, Wall Street executives say. In some cases, banks offer to sign up for the company’s services in order to win brownie points, executives say. Either way, the prevalence of banks that are also customers of companies they’re taking public raises some issues for investors considering buying stock in the IPOs, securities experts say. In particular, it can raise questions when companies don’t disclose that banks helping to market the offering are also paying clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">If you run an enterprise software company and you sign up 10 banks just before you go public, that might look like pretty meaningful customer and revenue growth, growth that might be impressive to potential IPO investors. And if they all signed up just for the pitch meeting, and cancel right after the IPO, that’s not ideal.</p>

I will not repeat here what I said yesterday, but in brief: (1) it’s weird, (2) it’s not how lawyers and bankers and executives are traditionally trained to think about shareholder value in mergers, (3) you’d expect it to lead to more mergers, and at lower premiums, and (4) empirically it does seem to have those effects.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Also though (5) I do not understand why it would be a problem under traditional notions of antitrust law? If it leads to more <em>mergers</em>, that is an interesting economic fact, but not one that modern antitrust law is really concerned with. If it leads to more <em>anticompetitive mergers</em>, then that is something that modern antitrust law will try to crack down on, but the crackdown will have nothing particularly to do with the common ownership of the target and acquirer by big institutional investors. Antitrust regulators should care about the economic effects of the merger, not the interests of the common shareholders. I think. </p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Take some of the largest proposed mergers of the past year: The Big Three, at the time the deals were announced, on average owned about 20% of the acquiring companies and their targets.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">For example, when Raytheon Co. and United Technologies Corp. announced their merger, BlackRock held about 8.1% of the former and 6.3% of the latter, while Vanguard owned 8.1% and 6.7%, respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. State Street’s stake was 4.4% and 10.5%, the data show.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Interesting! But:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The sheer size of index fund houses merits regulatory attention, said James Woolery, a partner at King &amp; Spalding, where he leads the M&amp;A and corporate governance practices. Though he did not comment specifically on the FTC, he said concentration of power among the three firms deserves more scrutiny.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">“That is the issue regulators need to deal with, across regimes,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I still don’t quite get it. The economic evidence is that having index funds on both sides makes mergers more likely, but that is irrelevant when you are <em>examining a merger</em>: The fact of the merger agreement tells you a lot more about the likelihood of the merger than the shareholder lists do! When regulators are examining the merger, though, they have to decide if the merger is anticompetitive or not, if it will raise prices. And there I don’t think the index fund ownership tells you anything.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Here’s a story about how the Tiger cubs, the hedge fund managers who worked for Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management and went on to start their own hedge funds, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjAtMDEtMjQvdGlnZXItY3Vicy10aGUtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLW1lZXQtY2hhc2UtY29sZW1hbi1zLXByb3RlZ2Vz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B85a91e95" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="Q4KVMODWLU6A" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">now have their own cubs</a>, hedge fund managers who worked for them and have now started their own, third generation of the Tiger lineage. That’s nice. One wants a sort of rational taxonomic naming system. Tiger cubs include Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management, both of which are annoying names for Tiger descendants: Vikings have nothing to do with tigers, while Tiger Global is much too close to regular old Tiger. And most of the Tiger grandcubs have names like Serenity Capital Management and Harbor Spring Capital an SRS Investment Management and even Untitled Investments, which convey no tigritude at all. One is called Cat Rock Capital though, that’s good.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But really all the Tiger cubs should have big-cat names—Lion Management, Lynx Management, Panther Management, please do not email me to tell me that these hedge funds actually exist, I’m sure they do—and the Tiger grandcubs should have housecat names. Persian Management, Ragdoll Management, Abyssinian Management, Russian Blue Management, Domestic Shorthair Management, these are actually pretty good, someone should start Ragdoll Management. I assume there will soon be a fourth generation. I don’t know. Catnip Capital, Ball of Yarn Investments, Laser Pointer Partners, Feather on a Stick Associates.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I guess if you are founding your own hedge fund you want to indicate that you are your own <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19253968.130231/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMjcvc29vbi1kaXJlY3QtbGlzdGluZ3Mtd2lsbC1yYWlzZS1tb25leQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bfe74559a" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="Q1N0LD6KLVR6" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">contrarian</a> person by breaking with the naming conventions of your predecessor, except for Coleman obviously, he just added “Global.” Still if you are a Tiger descendant you do seem to want to signal your lineage:</p>
