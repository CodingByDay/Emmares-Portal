The vehicles will start being deployed possibly as soon as 2020, with the whole fleet expected to be on the road by 2024. Rivian has been operating since 2009, but only debuted its pickup truck and SUV at the end of November 2018. The announcement by Amazon also serves as the introduction of Rivian's delivery vans. In 2019, it received funding from Amazon, Ford, and Cox Automotive. Rivian's vehicles start at around $70,000, can travel 400 miles on a single charge, hit 60 miles per hour in under three seconds, and will eventually be self-driving in some capacity. </p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F9%2F19%2F20869271%2Fimpossible-burger-foods-gelsons-markets-southern-california-meat-free-plant-based/1/0100016d4e26f72c-d751763f-3703-466c-b32d-8d578e5cf31b-000000/8gFf31oykEHwRCJmpFMzAJ_ja91QJDcTBADR4IEqWfs=107" target="_blank">Impossible Burgers are hitting their first grocery stores tomorrow (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The Impossible Burger will be available in grocery stores starting September 20 in 27 Gelson's Markets stores in Southern California. It will eventually be available in other areas, and Impossible Foods plans to reach every region of the US by the middle of next year.

Impossible Foods' burger is available in over 17,000 restaurants. Beyond Meat is working with KFC on a new plant-based 'chicken' recipe. The Impossible Burger will be available in 12-ounce packages for $8.99, and purchases will be limited to 10 packages per visit per customer.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2019%2F09%2F19%2Fwing-will-test-drone-delivery-in-the-us-with-walgreens-and-fedex%2F/1/0100016d4e26f72c-d751763f-3703-466c-b32d-8d578e5cf31b-000000/nKTwRKuDKIGosW6N2yZXTDjiuymaYx_mBRhwSzK7SI4=107" target="_blank">Wing will test drone delivery in the US with Walgreens and FedEx (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Wing will be launching a test program in Virginia with Walgreens, FedEx, and Sugar Magnolia. It will deliver snacks, over-the-counter medicines, and other selected packages. Only 22,000 people in Montgomery County will be eligible as Wing continues to figure out what works and what doesn't. When customers place an order, Wing's delivery drones head to a specific delivery location, where a human operator hooks a package onto the drone. The drone cruises at about 60-70 mph to the delivery location, where it lowers the package to the ground to be released. Packages can be up to 3 lbs. Delivery during the test phase will be free, and the first delivery will begin next month.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.newscientist.com%2Farticle%2F2217050-a-hat-that-zaps-the-scalp-with-electricity-helps-reverse-male-balding%2F/1/0100016d4e26f72c-d751763f-3703-466c-b32d-8d578e5cf31b-000000/GYRFaOxJQ1Nk630Jb2F-hyvC9F3Vp_eFXg6MHIDPYSI=107" target="_blank">A hat that zaps the scalp with electricity helps reverse male balding (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Currently, men can treat hair loss using minoxidil, finasteride, or hair transplant surgery, but these treatments do not always work for everyone or can be too expensive or painful. Stimulating the scalp with electric pulses has been shown to restore hair growth. Scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed a wireless patch that sticks to the scalp and generates electric pulses by harnessing energy from random body movements. The patch is made of materials that produce electricity when they come into contact and separate again. It was successful in growing hair in rats, with faster growth and hair density than using just a minoxidil solution. The team has designed a baseball cap that uses this material and is currently seeking approval to test it in men in a clinical trial. </p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Farzzen%2Fgit-quick-stats%2F/1/0100016d4e26f72c-d751763f-3703-466c-b32d-8d578e5cf31b-000000/URvG-UySfdDZQMrhXJymS1kfRgSAguIOLkzD0dK0GjU=107" target="_blank">GIT quick statistics (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">GIT quick statistics helps developers access various statistics in a git repository in a simple and efficient way.
