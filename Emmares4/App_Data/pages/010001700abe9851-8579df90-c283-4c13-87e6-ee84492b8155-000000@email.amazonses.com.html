It has also limited employee travel to China to 'business critical' matters. Apple provided care kits to employees, regularly took employees' temperatures, and deep cleaned its stores and offices in the Wuhan area. Its online store will remain open.

The device enhances a jellyfish's natural motions using electrical impulses, similar to the way a pacemaker regulates heart rate. Once attached, the cyborg jellyfish can swim almost three times faster than unmodified jellyfish while using only twice the metabolic energy. The device doesn't harm the jellyfish and there are no negative effects after being removed. Scientists hope to be able to use cyborg jellyfish to carry sensors into the ocean to gather data from hard-to-reach locations.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fglobaltimesnews%2Fstatus%2F1223218977570078721/1/010001700abe9851-8579df90-c283-4c13-87e6-ee84492b8155-000000/I4cjTxlpRbeId8LtMn9bM2oLEcP48-1J57dg-50fPwo=126" target="_blank">Walking around without a protective face mask?

In the second year, the business was still not profitable, but it had improved significantly. Lynch worked on several projects, with his 'Is It Keto' both bringing in the most revenue and having the highest running costs. During this time, he learned that higher prices could actually bring in more customers, ideas need to be screened and dumped when appropriate, having higher goals can result in bigger wins, and that life is much more enjoyable as a founder.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F1%2F31%2F21116427%2Felon-musk-song-edm-soundcloud/1/010001700abe9851-8579df90-c283-4c13-87e6-ee84492b8155-000000/TedvqXsUBXsyBrwdV0f_JS6rZyc1FSvOHzVnW47ls7Q=126" target="_blank">Elon Musk releases ‘Don’t Doubt Ur Vibe’ song on SoundCloud, Spotify (1 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Elon Musk has released his latest single 'Don't Doubt Ur Vibe' on SoundCloud and Spotify under the label Emo G Records.

Managers distributed anti-union literature prior to the vote, claiming that a union would drain paychecks and have a great deal of control over workers. Most of Instacart's workforce are independent contractors, but around 12,000 workers are legally employees. Instacart has stated that it supports the action of its workers. Workers at Instacart do not receive healthcare and other benefits as their work hours are capped at 29 hours a week. The tech industry has seen unprecedented levels of organization amongst its workers recently. In the last few months, many companies have experienced worker-led strikes, protests, and online boycotts. The victory sends a message to other gig workers around the country who are fed up with working conditions at Silicon Valley tech companies.</p> <br><br>
