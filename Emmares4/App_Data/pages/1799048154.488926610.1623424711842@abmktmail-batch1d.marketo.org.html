</div> Hey,
<br>
<br>I just wanted to send you a quick note to remind you that prices are increasing tonight for TechCrunch's founder bootcamp series, 
<a href="https://mailing.techcrunch.com/MjcwLVdSWS03NjIAAAF9mp_soOokskf3F1LPs2P9twWI5E9NqpsjvbdWmeIl1h3Z-Uh6VrhwpYUZyhZnXsCDGdSTvR0=" target="_blank" id="">TC Early Stage</a>, happening July 8 &amp; 9.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>This time we're&nbsp;bringing the 
<strong>experts that focus&nbsp;on everything marketing</strong> - to help you fine-tune your marketing strategy, make sure your product is aligned with the marketplace, and even how to tell your company's story&nbsp;so you stand out from the crowd. 
<br>
<br>And of course&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;have plenty of opportunities to engage with leading investors who will&nbsp;give tips on how you can fund it all. Take a peek at the courses you'll get access to 
<a href="https://mailing.techcrunch.com/MjcwLVdSWS03NjIAAAF9mp_soE9MXlbKiScNvDD3T8Kt-tfu5oxk8_ttUHH9CGq3PuL33uMZHb8yWlRsk6UL4b1qYHU=" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>
<br>But one of the best things about this event is the community of founders that gather from around the world to share their experience, knowledge and even collaborate on projects. You'll get access to the tools&nbsp;to discover and make connections with ambitious founders like yourself. Who knows? You might even find your next co-founder!
<br>
