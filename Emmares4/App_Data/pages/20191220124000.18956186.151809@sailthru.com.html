<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I’ve probably been doing this too long, because I find myself increasingly attracted to financial theories that say that bad things are actually good. The most fundamental of these theories is that investors prefer risk to safety, and so risky investments are valued more highly than safe ones. This is counterintuitive, but pretty well established. There’s a 2013 paper on “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cDovL3BhZ2VzLnN0ZXJuLm55dS5lZHUvfmxwZWRlcnNlL3BhcGVycy9CZXR0aW5nQWdhaW5zdEJldGEucGRm/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Be87b3461" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Betting Against Beta</a>” by Andrea Frazzini and Lasse Heje Pedersen of AQR Capital Management: For behavioral and leverage-constraint reasons, it seems “that risky high-beta assets require lower risk-adjusted returns than low-beta assets,” meaning that risky assets cost more than safe ones. “The <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NaXNzaW5nLVJpc2stUHJlbWl1bS1Wb2xhdGlsaXR5LUludmVzdGluZy9kcC8xNDcwMTEwOTcw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B4a689c26" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">missing risk premium</a>” and the “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvTG93LXZvbGF0aWxpdHlfYW5vbWFseQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B27a1619e" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">low volatility anomaly</a>” express similar ideas.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Or here is a paper by J.B. Heaton with the delightful title “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXBlcnMuc3Nybi5jb20vc29sMy9wYXBlcnMuY2ZtP2Fic3RyYWN0X2lkPTM0Mjc4NjA/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bbba22df3" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Is the Cost of Equity Greater than the Risk-Free Rate?</a>” As with betting against beta, the argument here is not exactly that investors love risk. They don’t like risk, but they have some constraint or blind spot that causes them to act like they do. For Frazzini and Pedersen the constraint is leverage: Investors who want a given level of risk are more comfortable getting it by buying a small amount of unlevered risky assets than by borrowing money to buy a large amount of low-risk assets, so the risky assets trade at a premium to the low-risk ones. For Heaton the problem is sort of psychological and epistemic, “the combination of excessive optimism with risk aversion.” But in any case the result is that investors seem to prefer risk over safety.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">What this <em>means</em>, in the framework of conventional finance theory, is that risky assets will <em>underperform </em>safe ones. If investors prefer risk over safety (or act like they do), then they overpay for risky assets, which means that those assets’ prices are higher, which means their expected future returns are lower. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Once you get comfortable with all of that, you might as well move on to see if there are other cases where investors strangely prefer bad characteristics over good ones. Here’s a fun one from Cliff Asness, who runs AQR, called “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXFyLmNvbS9JbnNpZ2h0cy9QZXJzcGVjdGl2ZXMvVGhlLUlsbGlxdWlkaXR5LURpc2NvdW50/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B29b65769" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">The Illiquidity Discount</a>.” It is inspired by AQR’s <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXFyLmNvbS9JbnNpZ2h0cy9SZXNlYXJjaC9XaGl0ZS1QYXBlcnMvRGVteXN0aWZ5aW5nLUlsbGlxdWlkLUFzc2V0cy1FeHBlY3RlZC1SZXR1cm5zLWZvci1Qcml2YXRlLUVxdWl0eQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B2835ca7f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">previous criticisms</a> of the private equity industry, which they argue has “artificially smooth returns”: Private-equity stakes don’t trade much, so their prices don’t move, so they don’t look volatile, so their risk-adjusted returns look better than those of public investments. But not trading is <em>bad</em>. Being able to buy and sell investments is preferable to not being able to do so. Liquidity is good. The apparent good risk-adjusted returns of private equity really reflect a <em>bad </em>lack of liquidity.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Asness asks, well, but what if the lack of liquidity is <em>good</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">If people get that PE is truly volatile but you just don’t see it, what’s all the excitement about? Well, big time multi-year illiquidity and its oft-accompanying pricing opacity may actually be a feature not a bug! Liquid, accurately priced investments let you know precisely how volatile they are and they smack you in the face with it. What if many investors actually realize that this accurate and timely information will make them worse investors as they’ll use that liquidity to panic and redeem at the worst times? What if illiquid, very infrequently and inaccurately priced investments made them better investors as essentially it allows them to ignore such investments given low measured volatility and very modest paper drawdowns? “Ignore” in this case equals “stick with through harrowing times when you might sell if you had to face up to the full losses.” What if investors are simply smart enough to know that they can take on a lot more risk (true long-term risk) if it’s simply not shoved in their face every day (or multi-year period!)? Could the same investor who finds private equity easy to stick with also find a levered publicly traded small-cap portfolio impossible to stick with even if they’re economically very similar investments? Sounds pretty plausible to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">This reads a little like a defense of illiquid investing against the objections of his colleagues. But it’s not, not exactly. Because conventional theory suggests that if investors prefer illiquidity over liquidity, then they overprice illiquid assets, which means that those assets’ expected future returns are lower:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Of course, the question is whether this stick-to-itiveness comes at a price (lower expected returns than the comparable risk but liquid and marked-to-market investment) and, if so, is that price large or small, and is it generally accepted as a cost of an easier ride or hidden? For instance, are investment committees being told “we like these investments, even at a potential return discount to comparable liquid aggressive investments, because we’ll all be better off in the long term if we just have less information”? …</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">So, I think it’s entirely possible that investors are accepting a discounted expected net return (though discounted from a high level as we are starting with levered small-cap not a low-risk, low-return investment) for the privilege of not being told the prices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">It is hard to read this and not think of the recent <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTItMTgvdGhlLXN0b3J5LWRvZXNuLXQtbWF0Y2gtdGhlLXZpc2lvbg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B630c2eb3" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="Q2PX19DWRGGA" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">unicorn boom</a>. Classically investors in private companies buy shares at relatively low valuations, and then the companies go public at higher valuations and the early investors get rich, and part of the explanation for the difference is liquidity: The early investors get limited liquidity before the initial public offering, the public investors get total liquidity after the IPO, and so the public investors will pay more for more of a good thing. But in recent years this has not always been true, and lots of big tech unicorns have gone public and been worth less than, or not much more than, their earlier private valuations.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One possible explanation for this is just an unlucky run of mistakes: Some private investors thought some companies would be worth more than they turned out to be worth. But you could try Asness’s reading. Perhaps it is at least <em>psychologically soothing </em>for the private investors to not have to worry about stock-price volatility, and they are willing to pay up for the pleasant experience of not being told they’re losing money. Perhaps it even <em>makes them better investors</em>. In fact that is often what they <em>say</em>: Private-company founders and venture capitalists pretty regularly complain that public stock prices are a distraction and that the volatility of public markets creates short-term thinking and reduces long-term value. If they mean it, then they should be willing to pay more to invest in still-private companies that don’t have daily stock-price moves to pay attention to.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">No doubt the venture capitalists are nodding along! “Yes, right, that’s exactly it, we can focus on building good businesses without the distraction of flighty investors and a volatile public stock price.” But note the corollary: If investors want illiquidity then they have to pay for it, and the way you pay for anything in financial markets is by accepting lower expected returns. The reason that unicorn valuations were often higher than the public market would bear might have been that investors enjoyed the unicorn experience more than the public-market experience. They just didn’t enjoy how it ended.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">All that aside, I think it is fair to say that, compared to public investments, private investments offer a higher chance of making a lot of money, and also a higher chance of losing all of your money. One conclusion that people sometimes draw from this is that more people should have access to private investments, because that will give more people the opportunity to make a lot of money. Another conclusion that other people sometimes draw from this is that <em>fewer </em>people should have access to private investments, because that will reduce their odds of losing a lot of money.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">This debate tends to focus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s “accredited investor” rules, which basically restrict U.S. private investments to people who make more than $200,000 a year ($300,000 for a couple) or have more than $1 million in net worth. Some people think it’s bad that only the relatively rich get access to the best-performing investments; other people think it’s bad that <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMDktMjQvZWFybmluZy10aGUtcmlnaHQtdG8tZ2V0LXN3aW5kbGVk/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bfcbc1a6b" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="PFMB5Z6S9728" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">the moderately rich get swindled</a> on poorly-performing private investments. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">On Wednesday, the SEC <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zZWMtcHJvcG9zZXMtZ2l2aW5nLW1vcmUtaW52ZXN0b3JzLWFjY2Vzcy10by1wcml2YXRlLW1hcmtldHMtMTE1NzY2OTE2ODU_bW9kPWl0cF93c2omcnU9eWFob28/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B5f09f4ef" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">proposed new rules</a> that would make it a bit easier to be an “accredited investor.” Here is <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9ydWxlcy9wcm9wb3NlZC8yMDE5LzMzLTEwNzM0LnBkZg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B8e825044" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">the proposal</a>. The most notable change is probably that now you will be able to be accredited by passing a test, not just by making enough money. (Making enough money is still fine, though.) Well, “passing a test” is not quite right; you will have to hold “in good standing one or more professional certifications or designations or credentials from an accredited educational institution that the Commission has designated as qualifying an individual for accredited investor status.” The SEC says that the Series 7, Series 65 and Series 82 securities licenses—which you can get by working in a relevant securities-industry job and passing a test—would qualify. Other credentials—like Chartered Financial Analyst and Certified Financial Planner designations—might also be considered. It is hard to argue too much with this. People with these credentials are financial-industry professionals, and you’d hope that they’d either be able to evaluate investments or at least know that they can’t and walk away. Fine.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But the general intent of the proposal is clearly to open up private investments more broadly. For instance, there have been calls to raise the financial thresholds to account for the fact that $200,000 isn’t what it used to be. In 1982, when the rules were adopted, about 1.6% of U.S. households counted as accredited; now the number is 13%. But the SEC is fine with this because now there is the internet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Notwithstanding the significant increase in the number of investors that qualify as accredited investors since 1982, we do not believe it necessary or appropriate to modify the definition’s financial thresholds at this time. … Although it may be argued that an investor with an income of $200,000 or a net worth of $1 million in 2019 is not as “wealthy” as such an investor would have been in 1982, the income and net worth levels currently required in the definition still exceed, by a large margin, the mean and median household income and household net worth in all regions of the country. … Further, we believe that in evaluating the effectiveness of the current thresholds, it is appropriate to consider changes beyond the impact of inflation, such as changes over the years in the availability of information and advances in technologies. Given the rise of the internet, social media, and other forms of communication, information about issuers and other participants in the exempt markets is more readily available to a wide range of market participants. Technologies such as powerful home computers and mobile computing devices, as well software-based tools with which to evaluate investment opportunities, were not available to investors at the time the accredited investor definition was promulgated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One thing that I tend to think about this controversy is that it often assumes that private markets are like public markets. If you are allowed to invest in private markets, then you will evaluate all the investments and try to choose the ones that will make you a lot of money. If you are good and smart and hard-working, you will choose the good ones, and there is no need for the government to prevent you from making good decisions or protect you from bad decisions.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But in fact the main thing that distinguishes public and private markets is not their legal status—private markets are mostly open to accredited investors, while public markets are open to everyone—but the fact that private companies <em>get to choose their investors</em>, and public companies don’t. Hedge funds, for instance, are mostly open only to accredited investors, but not all hedge funds are open to all accredited investors. The very best hedge funds mostly aren’t open to <em>anyone:</em> They are at capacity, won’t take new money, and mostly manage money for their own very rich employees. Other hedge funds with long track records of good performance are open to big institutional allocators who can write very large checks. If you are a dentist making $205,000 a year, and you want to invest in hedge funds … someone will definitely sell you a hedge fund! It will not be <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVuZ3VpbnJhbmRvbWhvdXNlLmNvbS9ib29rcy81NTcxMDQvdGhlLW1hbi13aG8tc29sdmVkLXRoZS1tYXJrZXQtYnktZ3JlZ29yeS16dWNrZXJtYW4v/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bca108781" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Renaissance</a>. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">This is not how public markets work. You want to invest with Warren Buffett? You can just buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., same as everyone else. The public investors with the least money can generally invest in exactly the same shares, on more or less exactly the same terms, as the public investors with the most money.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">It seems intuitive—and <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDYtMTkvcHJpdmF0ZS1tYXJrZXRzLWNvdWxkLWJlLW1vcmUtcHVibGlj/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bcdc60c67" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="PTCSHP6K50XS" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">I have suggested it before</a>—that there would be a sort of segmentation in the private markets, in which large institutions and very rich people would be offered private opportunities that are disproportionately good and fast-growing, while just-barely-accredited people would be offered private opportunities that are disproportionately frauds. This is not always 100% true, and you could point to, I don’t know, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTItMTgvdGhlLXN0b3J5LWRvZXNuLXQtbWF0Y2gtdGhlLXZpc2lvbg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115C630c2eb3" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="Q2PX19DWRGGA" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">SoftBank’s greatest misses</a> as evidence for the fact that sometimes big institutions buy duds. But on the whole, the companies with the best opportunities will probably want to raise private capital efficiently from a small group of big investors, while the companies with the worst opportunities will probably market themselves heavily to dentists. In dissenting from the proposal, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9uZXdzL3B1YmxpYy1zdGF0ZW1lbnQvc3RhdGVtZW50LWphY2tzb24tMjAxOS0xMi0xOC1hY2NyZWRpdGVkLWludmVzdG9y/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B2aa53885" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">points out</a> that “brokers who put investors in private securities are unusually likely to be the subject of both customer complaints related to sales practices and regulatory inquiries about misconduct.” The brokers marketing private placements to dentists are not, on average, <em>more </em>careful and reputable than the ones <em>not</em> marketing those private placements.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Still I can accept the intuition that, if someone knowingly wants to take the risk of investing in a possible dud, the SEC shouldn’t stop them just because they’re not rich enough. That’s why I have long advocated <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMDktMjQvZWFybmluZy10aGUtcmlnaHQtdG8tZ2V0LXN3aW5kbGVk/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Cfcbc1a6b" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="PFMB5Z6S9728" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">my own definition of accredited investor</a>, which is that anyone can be accredited just by acknowledging, in writing, to the SEC, that (1) they know they’re going to lose their money and (2) they are not allowed to complain when they do. That idea is still a little bit alive in the SEC’s proposal, which asks, “Should we consider permitting individuals to self-certify that they have the requisite financial sophistication to be an accredited investor as another means for determining investor sophistication?” It’s not quite as strong as my version, and it doesn’t seem like the direction they’re going in, but I think it’s the right idea.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Most of the big retail discount brokerages in the U.S. engage in a practice called “payment for order flow.” If you send your broker an order to buy stock, instead of sending it to the stock exchange, they will send it to a big electronic market maker who will sell you the stock out of their inventory. The market maker really wants to trade with your order, because it is, in the market maker’s worldview, “non-toxic.” If they make markets on a stock exchange, they face a high risk of adverse selection. If they hold themselves out as willing to buy stock for $10.02 or sell it at $10.05, and someone comes in and sells to them at $10.02, there’s a good chance that that means the stock is worth less than $10.02: The seller could be a high-frequency trader who sees the price shifting, or it could be a giant mutual fund that is dumping a lot of stock and will drive the price down. But retail investors tend to buy small amounts of stock, all at once, without moving the market, so a market maker who buys for $10.02 and sells at $10.05 will reliably make three cents a share without a lot of risk.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Market makers want this pleasant order flow and are willing to pay for it. They generally pay for it in two ways. First, they offer “price improvement.” That hypothetical three-cent public market spread pays public market makers for the risk of adverse selection, but a retail market maker doesn’t face that risk and can charge less. If the public market’s best bid and offer are $10.02 at $10.05, the market maker might be willing to buy from retail accounts for $10.025 and sell at $10.045. So you get a better price on your stock than you’d get in the public markets.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Second, market makers actually just write the brokerage firm a check for sending your order flow to them. (This is the payment for order flow.) The brokerage firms have a choice of market makers to send orders to, and the market makers compete for the brokerages’ favor by paying them money.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">It seems to me that these two payment streams are, for market makers, essentially interchangeable. If a market maker decides that it can afford to pay one cent a share for retail orders in some particular stock, then it should be mostly indifferent between paying one cent a share to the retail brokerage as payment for order flow, or giving one cent a share of spread improvement to the brokerage’s customers, or any split in between (pay $0.0025 to the brokerage and improve the spread by $0.0075, etc.). There are details—you’d measure these things in different ways, etc.—but on average this should be roughly right. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Obviously the retail brokerages want to get as much as possible of the money in the form of payment for order flow (which they keep) and as little as possible in the form of price improvement (which their customers keep), but there are constraints on this. For one thing, brokers are obligated to seek “best execution” for their customers, a somewhat nebulous standard but one that requires them to care about price improvement. For another thing, the retail brokerage business is competitive and they want to be able to advertise good execution. Also, though, the retail brokerage business is competitive and they don’t exactly, entirely “keep” the payment for order flow. It’s just a revenue stream that they can use to pay for stuff their clients want. One thing that it pays for is keeping commissions low. These days <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMDIvdGhlLXRyYWRlcy13aWxsLWJlLWZyZWUtbm93/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bb3e9c509" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="PYR8PN6JIJUQ" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">commissions are zero</a>. The brokers’ expenses aren’t zero. The zero commissions are funded in part by payment for order flow. (Though often, mostly, by net interest margin.) The market makers pay the brokers to trade so the customers don’t have to pay the brokers to trade.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But until recently the customers did have to pay the brokers to trade; most discount brokerages charged, like, $4.95 per trade or whatever until this fall. One did not: Robinhood Financial LLC made a big splash, and attracted millions of customers, by charging zero commissions long before most other brokers did. Like other discount brokers, it paid for this in part by collecting payment for order flow.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">People got very upset at Robinhood over this, partly for what seemed to me to be non-rational reasons. The fact that Robinhood charged less than its competitors seemed to make people think that it was somehow <em>hypocritical </em>for Robinhood to accept payment for order flow like its competitors did, that Robinhood’s free trading somehow obligated it to be more pure and unconflicted than everyone else.

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">And <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMTAtMTYvY2FybC1pY2Fobi13YW50cy10by1maWdodC1kZWxsLWFnYWlu/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bc45b1346" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">I said</a>, well, yes, taking money from Citadel Securities (in the form of payment for order flow) and giving it to customers (in the form of free trades) fits quite well with a steal-from-the-rich ethos! </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But there was also a rational reason to get upset at Robinhood over this, which is that it was widely believed to be accepting relatively <em>more </em>money from market makers in the form of payment for order flow and <em>less </em>in the form of price improvement. I don’t really know if this was true—the statistics on this stuff are pretty non-transparent—but it did <em>make sense</em>. Robinhood probably had fewer revenue streams than other big discount brokerages; also, it <em>charged lower commissions</em>. The money for that had to come from somewhere. Payment for order flow probably doesn’t cover that much of it—we’re talking fractions of pennies per share, which does not get you to $4.95 per trade—but it’s a start. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Also I guess it was true: Yesterday the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that it was <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18956186.151809/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmlucmEub3JnL21lZGlhLWNlbnRlci9uZXdzcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS9maW5yYS1maW5lcy1yb2Jpbmhvb2QtZmluYW5jaWFsLWxsYy0xMjUtbWlsbGlvbi1iZXN0LWV4ZWN1dGlvbg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B9100c91e" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">fining Robinhood $1.25 million</a> for not trying hard enough to get price improvement for customers in 2016 and 2017:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">FINRA found that for more than a year, Robinhood—which offers its customers the ability to trade in equity securities without being charged commissions—routed its customers’ non-directed equity orders to four broker-dealers, all of which paid Robinhood for that order flow. This arrangement is known in the brokerage industry as payment for order flow.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">FINRA Rule 5310—Best Execution—requires firms to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the best market for the subject security and buy or sell in such market so that the resultant price to the customer is as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions. FINRA member firms that route customer orders away for execution can satisfy their best execution obligations by conducting either an order-by-order review of execution quality or a “regular and rigorous review.” FINRA Rule 5310 enumerates a number of criteria for firms to evaluate in these reviews. During its reviews, Robinhood did not reasonably consider the Rule 5310 execution quality factors (such as price improvement) that the firm could obtain from alternative markets. Instead, Robinhood’s Best Execution Committee materials focused only on the execution quality of its pre-existing routing destinations, all of which paid Robinhood for that order flow. </p>

Robinhood’s thing was that you could trade for free. If you did that, you saved something like $4.95 per trade. If in exchange you got half a cent per share less price improvement, then on a hundred-share order Robinhood would cost you 50 cents on execution and save you $4.95 on commissions. Still seems fine?</p>
