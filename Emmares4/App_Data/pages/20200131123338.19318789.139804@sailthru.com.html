There are a handful of startups competing in some new sector. SoftBank swoops in and funds one of them with much, much more money than it wants. The infusion of SoftBank cash gives the favored company an immediate and insurmountable competitive advantage. It can expand internationally, everywhere, while its competitors grow slowly; it can out-compete everyone else by cutting prices to win customers. With limitless money to spend it can eliminate the competition and dominate the category. (This is sometimes called “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19318789.139804/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2lyZWQuY29tL3N0b3J5L2JsaXR6c2NhbGluZy1pcy1jaG9raW5nLWlubm92YXRpb24v/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B66d3b5e9" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">blitzscaling</a>.”) Its rapid growth will come at the expense of huge near-term losses, but SoftBank doesn’t care. It is playing the long game, and if you own the dominant player in a big global category surely you can find a way to make it profitable. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One thing to say about this strategy is that, if this is your plan, it seems very important to pick <em>one </em>company per sector. Pump one company full of your money so it can cut prices, undercut the competition and gain a dominant market share, sure, great. Pump <em>two </em>companies full of your money and they will just keep undercutting each other down to zero, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19318789.139804/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zb2Z0YmFuay1pcy1mdW5kaW5nLWV2ZXJ5LXNpZGUtb2YtbGF0aW4tYW1lcmljYXMtYnJ1aXNpbmctc3RhcnR1cC1iYXR0bGUtMTE1ODAzOTg5MDA/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bd0c56708" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">oops</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Uber is under siege in Latin America amid a bruising price war where its ostensible rivals are Rappi and China’s Didi Chuxing Technology Co. But here’s the twist. All the combatants have as their biggest owner the same tech investor, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., which has injected a total of $20 billion into the three.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Startup investors typically don’t back competing companies. SoftBank, which runs the world’s largest venture-capital fund, has poured so much money into popular tech categories that it created a sort of circular firing squad in which SoftBank-backed companies use SoftBank cash to attack one another. …</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The SoftBank-funded fight is “just bad business,” said Chris Sacca, founder of Lowercase Capital, an early investor in Uber. “When an investor infuses multiple direct competitors with money to spend in a race to the bottom, it’s just a waste.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Oh I mean, sure, absolutely, but in these situations it is instructive to remove a few layers of abstraction and just think about what is actually happening here. At one end, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia plows gigantic piles of money into SoftBank’s Vision Fund. At the other end, Mexico City’s “legendary late-night snack spot El Moro” can have someone “deliver its churros and hot cocoa to takeout customers across the capital” well below cost, subsidized by the Vision Fund. The King of Saudi Arabia is sending hot chocolate to everyone in Mexico City. Here, have this nice hot chocolate, on the King of Saudi Arabia. Modern capitalism is always so much stranger than you expect.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">It is also useful, though, to ask: How else could this have gone? This seems irrational, yes, but how could things have been arranged differently to get a rational result?</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Well, SoftBank could have just picked one of these companies to invest in and tried to make it the dominant power everywhere. That seems pretty simple. Perhaps it wanted to diversify its geographic bets? None of these companies are originally Mexican; Uber started in the U.S., Didi in China and Rappi in Colombia. “Only fund one competitor in a global winner-take-all business” does seem like the simplest solution, but perhaps it is not obvious that taxis and restaurant delivery are in fact global winner-take-all businesses. Before Uber, to be fair, they definitely were not.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">There are other approaches. For instance, if Didi’s managers had said “we think it makes good business sense to get into the Mexican market,” and SoftBank’s representatives had said “no you can’t do that, Uber’s already there and we own them too” (or if they’d said “okay fine, but you can’t undercut Uber on price”), SoftBank could have saved a lot of money. But that seems like a <em>very</em> straightforward antitrust problem, the sort of thing that regulators dislike and ban and investigate and punish. Companies are not supposed to explicitly coordinate with each other to divide up markets and avoid price competition; doing the coordination through common shareholders doesn’t make it any better.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Or Didi could have just decided for itself not to move into the Mexican market, given the prospect of ruinous competition. Perhaps in weighing this decision it could even have quietly considered the fact that its big shareholder SoftBank had some competing economic interests. “If we move into Mexico it’ll be expensive and risky and even if it works out perfectly it won’t be that great for one of our big investors, so let’s not,” Didi’s managers could reasonably have thought. My general sense is that startup founders, and corporate executives generally, do not often think like this; they put more of a priority on winning than they do on maximizing payoffs for their real shareholders’ portfolios. But this is certainly a theory, and we <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19318789.139804/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTUtMDQtMTYvc2hvdWxkLW11dHVhbC1mdW5kcy1iZS1pbGxlZ2FsLQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Be9600fab" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="NMX7X86JTSEV" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">talk</a> about <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19318789.139804/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTUtMDctMjIvaW5kZXgtZnVuZHMtbWF5LXdvcmstYS1saXR0bGUtdG9vLXdlbGw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B4e6451dd" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="NRWOVU6KLVRG" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">it</a> a <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19318789.139804/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMTItMDcvcmVndWxhdG9ycy1hc2staWYtaW5kZXgtZnVuZHMtYXJlLWJhZA/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Baca9c24a" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="PJDKGN6JTSEB" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">lot</a> in the public markets.

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Or if instead of being three companies each partially owned by SoftBank, these were all divisions of <em>one </em>company—SoftBank Global Transit Inc. or whatever—then there would be no problem here.

(Actually many companies <em>do </em>have some overlap between their divisions, and make their divisions compete with each other, but mostly in a keep-everyone-on-their-toes managerial-strategy way, not in a ruinous-race-to-the-bottom way.) The “SoftBank representative” at each division would just be its “boss,” and the boss would tell the division what to do in order to maximize the company’s profit as a whole, and each division would do it, and there’d be no hint of controversy. </p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Uber and DoorDash held talks to combine last year in a deal that would have accelerated the long-awaited consolidation of the lossmaking food delivery industry, according to people close to the discussions.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The talks, held roughly six months ago, took place at the behest of Japan’s SoftBank, a shareholder in both companies through its $100bn Vision Fund, these people added. While the merger discussions did not result in a deal, the two sides have not ruled out returning to negotiations or attempting to merge with a rival.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">DoorDash executives were cool towards the idea of a merger at the time, believing that their own food delivery service had stronger growth prospects than Uber’s service, Uber Eats.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">DoorDash declined to comment. An Uber spokesman said: “We’re in constant dialogue with all our shareholders, but to be clear: our M&amp;A strategy is ours and ours alone.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Nobody would have said that last sentence five years ago! It just would not have occurred to a normal company in normal times to say “our shareholders don’t tell us who to merge with.” Whether or not it was true—in fact there is a long history of public companies proudly ignoring shareholder desires on mergers, and a different long history of other public companies being forced into mergers by big activist shareholders—it just wasn’t that controversial. Yeah, sure, listen to your shareholders, or don’t; these are issues of corporate governance, not of antitrust law.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But now there is a lot more attention paid to the idea that common shareholders of companies might push them to merge for anticompetitive reasons. U.S. regulators are <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19318789.139804/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjAtMDEtMjMvaW5kZXgtZnVuZHMtbWF0dGVyLWZvci1tZXJnZXJz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B2c00fca6" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="Q4KLPH6TTDS1" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">asking public companies</a> what influence their common shareholders had over merger decisions. I consistently find this question <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19318789.139804/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjAtMDEtMjQvZ29sZG1hbi13b24tdC11bmRlcndyaXRlLWp1c3QtYW55b25l/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B7928c7e1" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="Q4MGH26KLVRC" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">a little perplexing</a>: If companies are merging for anticompetitive reasons (“we would like to stop competing and raise prices”), or if their merger is likely to have anticompetitive effects (less competition and higher prices), then those are reasons for antitrust regulators to act, whether or not they had common shareholders before the merger, and whether or not they talked to those shareholders.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But I guess I can see the point here. The dynamic here really might be that Uber and DoorDash (and Didi and Rappi for that matter) are run by executives who believe that they are in a winner-take-all market, who believe that they can win, and who have huge (SoftBank-supplied) resources to try to win by undercutting each other on price. That is rational for Uber executives (if you win you get rich, and you think you can do it), rational for DoorDash executives (ditto), and irrational for SoftBank (you’re paying for both of their efforts). In this dynamic the Uber executives won’t want to merge (they’d rather win), the DoorDash executives won’t want to merge (they’d rather win), the SoftBank representatives will want them to, and the antitrust authorities definitely <em>won’t </em>want them to. Free hot chocolate for everyone is exactly the sort of consumer benefit that antitrust law is supposed to protect. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Of course the dynamic might be different—if the DoorDash executives <em>didn't </em>think they had stronger growth prospects, for instance, they might want to sell while they could—and then a merger might be efficient and pro-consumer and favored by the antitrust authorities. But asking “do you want to do this merger or did SoftBank put you up to it” could be a reasonable way to find out.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">To preserve the benefits of active funds, we explore the possibility of employing tax mechanisms to help defray the extra cost born by active funds. In particular, we argue for using tax credits to support active funds and enhance their market share. We also argue that, at a minimum, active funds should be subject to the same tax burden as passive ones, which should level the playing field in capital markets. We discuss two types of tax credits: effort-based tax credits and result-based tax credits. Effort-based tax credits would be granted whenever an active fund undertakes specified measures to improve corporate governance irrespective of their success. Result-based tax credits would be contingent on the attainment of certain outcomes. The two types are not mutually exclusive and can be combined for maximal effect.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Effort-based tax credits would provide funds a tax credit for the expenses incurred by their monitoring activity, such as execution of proxy contests and the cost of analysts focusing on corporate governance issues, and how to vote the fund’s shares. Result-based credit would provide a firm tax credits based on certain outcomes, such as passing a shareholder proposal, winning a proxy contest, gaining representation on a board, or increasing share values. A result-based credit would be calculated after controlling for non-governance factors such as market-wide or sector movement of share prices and firm-specific commercial events.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Ironically, what Don’t Doubt Ur Vibe really sounds like isn’t a primetime dancefloor banger, but the kind of atmospheric, inoffensive music that might play in the background at the launch of a new car. Still, at least it comes with an unexpected bonus: if you leave Soundcloud running after the track ends, the app, for reasons that aren’t entirely clear (algorithms? Mischievous intent?) immediately moves from the nascent oeuvre of Elon Musk to the work of a rapper called almndjoy, automatically playing his track Erectile Dysfunction .... Languishing unnoticed on Soundcloud for a year, it’s seen a vast upsurge in plays since Musk’s track made its debut, replete with a series of comments indicating that “Elon brought me here”. Perhaps that will be Elon Musk’s most lasting musical legacy: he’s brought Erectile Dysfunction to the masses.</p>
