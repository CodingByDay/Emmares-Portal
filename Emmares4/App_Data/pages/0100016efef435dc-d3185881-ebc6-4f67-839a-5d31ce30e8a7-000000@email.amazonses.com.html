Flu Lab is a company that provides funding for flu vaccine development initiatives. It funds a program called Shoo The Flu that provides flu shots for school children in Oakland, California. Shoo The Flu's director is also the CEO of Flu Lab. The goal of the funding is to create a universal flu vaccine, which would mean that one shot would protect people for more than one flu season. A final product is still likely years away. As both companies are private, they are not required to file public tax returns, nor are they required to reveal what they do with the money that they receive.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.digitaltrends.com%2Fcool-tech%2Frobot-bartending-company-automation-stipend%2F/1/0100016efef435dc-d3185881-ebc6-4f67-839a-5d31ce30e8a7-000000/7rSNMvw_q1zDGi0loNmXjJekLeLqehYp1E0sqYt0_5w=119" target="_blank">Robot bartending company is handing out cash to the people it is replacing (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Automation will have a massive impact on employment in the coming decade.

Ring cameras are home surveillance devices that have been heavily marketed by Amazon. The devices have been wildly popular, with even some police departments around the country signing partnerships with Amazon to sell the devices to citizens. Recently, software to hack Ring devices has become popular on some forums. The hacks have gained mainstream media attention and the Nulled forums have removed all posts regarding the hacks as a response. They have also banned all discussion about Ring hacks. The podcast will continue to run.</p> <br><br>
