	   <p style="margin:0;padding-bottom:10px;">Over the past few years, a growing number of researchers and companies worldwide have been developing techniques for automated driving. Before self-driving vehicles can be introduced on real roads, however, their efficiency and safety will need to be ascertained.</p>

	   <p style="margin:0;padding-bottom:10px;">A new study led by NIMS researchers reveals that in solid electrolytes, a silicon anode composed only of commercial silicon nanoparticles prepared by spray deposition exhibits excellent electrode performance, which has previously been observed only for film electrodes prepared by evaporation processes. The method is a cost-effective, atmospheric technique, and his new result therefore suggests that a low-cost and large-scale production of high-capacity anodes for use in all-solid-state lithium batteries is possible.</p>
