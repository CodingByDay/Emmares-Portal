There have been four incidents involving team members accessing Ring video data for reasons not related to their work. Ring promptly investigated each incident after they were made aware of the alleged conduct. The company has also taken steps to limit data access to a smaller number of people. Currently, only three employees can access stored customer videos. Ring has previously granted workers in Ukraine access to some user video for research purposes, but express consent was obtained from the users for the use of the videos. It has recently implemented new security features such as two-factor authentication.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.sandiegouniontribune.com%2Fbusiness%2Fstory%2F2019-12-25%2Flab-grown-fish-just-got-real-san-diego-startup-shows-off-first-slaughter-free-yellowtail/1/0100016f89ffd7f8-b7833853-4bed-4cbf-9fcf-dcd3dfd9eef4-000000/ZXFEIUb73S6F-EDKd3MJcyqJj6YjvVcJ3kPi932Gk0Q=123" target="_blank">Lab-grown fish just got real. San Diego startup shows off first slaughter-free yellowtail (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">BlueNalu, a San Diego-based food-tech startup, has grown fillets of yellowtail fish entirely from cells. The company is less than two years old. Last week it presented the fish in several dishes at an event at San Diego Bay. BlueNalu claims that their meat is no different from products like Greek yogurt, ketchup, or Oreos, all of which are created in labs. Wild Type is a San Francisco-based company that is creating lab-grown salmon, but its meat falls apart when cooked at high temperatures, unlike BlueNalu's yellowtail fish fillets. One of BlueNalu's biggest challenges is to scale up their operations. It plans to launch its seafood products into a test market within two years.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.jpost.com%2FIsrael-News%2FIsraels-Defense-Ministry-announces-breakthrough-in-laser-technology-613568/1/0100016f89ffd7f8-b7833853-4bed-4cbf-9fcf-dcd3dfd9eef4-000000/D8RT0hvT8C_DTz91fFdE293stWFJLK-ng9M5BDn0uo8=123" target="_blank">Israel unveils breakthrough laser to intercept missiles, aerial threats (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Israel's Defense Ministry has created a laser that can intercept rockets and antitank guided missiles. It is based on a precision laser beam that can be focused on long-range targets and overcome atmospheric disturbances such as clouds and dust storms. Several high-energy electric laser beams are connected into one strong beam using an advanced algorithm. High-energy lasers are able to be used continually at a low cost. The weapon can be used as long as there is electricity. Israel's Defense Ministry has launched three programs that will use the laser system on the ground, on a maneuverable platform-mounted system, and in the air. There will be several trials of the weapon throughout the year, and if it is effective, it will be deployed to the Gaza border area.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fhackernoon.com%2Fthe-six-most-important-things-junior-developers-need-to-know-to-begin-and-sustain-their-it-careers-vir3tkt/1/0100016f89ffd7f8-b7833853-4bed-4cbf-9fcf-dcd3dfd9eef4-000000/NfRVS4tr2l_7kU3IVOfhCvWY-BmLaEl47zLhSR-bGUQ=123" target="_blank">6 Most Important Things Every Junior Developer Should Know (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">You don't need a computer science degree to become a software developer. The skill can be self-taught. Having patience with yourself during the learning process will allow you to easier learn from your mistakes. Good companies will understand that you are learning. The ability to learn is vital since the field is always changing. Knowing the key concepts of programming will help you adapt, as while languages, frameworks, platforms, and other things might change, the core concepts will stay the same. Always try to see if there are existing libraries in order to save time. Reading other people's code is a great way to learn how others have solved problems. You do not have to learn all by yourself. There are many resources and forums out there. Finding help in the form of a mentor can be very beneficial in your career development.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbeefytech%2FBeef/1/0100016f89ffd7f8-b7833853-4bed-4cbf-9fcf-dcd3dfd9eef4-000000/TOQiFPBgIMVGp01SzL3VV8vEIt5_UzaZMbozcDPv29I=123" target="_blank">Beef Programming Language (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Beef is an open-source performance-oriented compiled programming language.

The attack occurred on New Year's Eve and it forced Travelex to take down its websites across 30 countries. A ransomware gang called Sodinokibi has claimed responsibility for the attack, demanding $6 million from Travelex. It claims to have obtained 5GB of sensitive customer data, including dates of birth, credit card information, and national insurance numbers. The Information Commissioner's Office has not received a data breach report from Travelex. Travelex has been working with police and has deployed IT specialists and external cyber-security experts to investigate the issue.

The changes will be implemented to promote healthy public conversation and to ensure the integrity of information on the platform. Twitter's conversation interface will be updated, making it easier to follow ongoing threads. Users will be able to choose who is able to reply to a given tweet. Twitter Topics will be able to algorithmically detect events happening around the world and it will have filters to ensure compliance with community guidelines. Machine learning moderation was able to effectively proactively remove half of all abusive tweets by the end of last year. Twitter will continue to develop these abilities and also extend them to remove misleading or otherwise toxic political messaging.</p> <br><br>
