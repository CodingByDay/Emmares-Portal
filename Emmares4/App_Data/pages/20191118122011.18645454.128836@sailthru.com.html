<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One reason that a company might do a direct listing instead of a standard initial public offering is that it wants to sell its stock at a price set by the market rather than a price negotiated by investment bankers and big institutional shareholders. If you do an IPO, your investment bankers call up big investors and take orders and build a book of demand at some price, and then they come back to you and say “you can sell the stock you want to sell at $20” or whatever, and you do, and then the stock starts trading and usually it goes up 10 or 20% or so. Sometimes it goes down, though; this is not an exact science, and the bankers will never build up a perfect picture of demand that exactly matches the ultimate result in the market.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If you do a direct listing, on the other hand, your stock just gets listed on the stock exchange, and early investors can sell to new ones, and whatever price balances supply and demand is the price. You—the company—don’t sell stock in a direct listing, but the listing does create a price. And then if you want to sell stock a month later, you can: There’s generally no “lockup” in a direct listing, so you can choose to sell whenever the price seems good to you. As with any big secondary offering, if you sell stock it will probably price at a discount to the market price, but the market price will probably be the main reference point for investors thinking about buying the stock after the direct listing.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">It is <em>conceivable</em>—I don’t know of any examples, but in theory it seems basically workable[1]—that a company that had no urgent need for money might start an IPO process, meet with bankers, feel out interest from big investors, get disappointing feedback (“you’re not going to be able to price this deal at a valuation above $15”), decide that the bankers and big investors undervalue the company, and scrap the IPO and go for a direct listing instead. You do the direct listing, the stock starts trading, it goes to $25, and then you go do a stock offering, as an already-public company, based on your existing trading price. You sell stock at $23 or whatever—a discount to the trading price, but above what the bankers thought they could get you in an IPO—and then you go to the bankers and say “see we told you.”</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One risk here is that you’re wrong and in fact the stock is worth $15, or $10 for that matter; once you do the direct listing the stock might trade down and then you’ll never be able to sell stock at the price you wanted. A subtler risk is that the stock really is worth $25 when you do the direct listing, because only a small amount of stock comes loose in the direct listing, and the demand for that small amount of stock is strong.[2] But if you want to sell a large amount of stock, you’ll need to get more big investors and sell at a much lower price; supply and demand determine the price of the stock, the demand curve slopes down, and the price of the stock after a small initial listing doesn’t tell you much about the price of the stock in a large public offering. That is a real risk. Still, the public trading price of a stock is often a pretty good indication of what people will pay for it, a good starting point and anchor for their valuation. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I certainly don’t think that this is a complete model of the Saudi Aramco IPO, but it is probably how I’d start to think about it. Saudi Arabia wanted to sell some of its stake in Aramco to big reputable international institutional investors at a valuation of $2 trillion. The investors said “no thanks.” Or, I mean, they were never exactly asked directly, but informal pre-roadshow inquiries by Aramco’s banks suggested that it would be hard to get a lot of demand from international institutions at anywhere near that price. Saudi Arabia <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18645454.128836/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvY2VjYmVkZDAtMDdjNy0xMWVhLWE5ODQtZmJiYWNhZDllN2Rk/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B79b272ff" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">was not happy</a>:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Saudi Arabian officials have told bankers they are unhappy with the level of foreign demand for Saudi Aramco, adding to pressure ahead of an investor roadshow due to start on Sunday.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Advisers informed officials this week about a gulf in demand between domestic investors and foreign institutions in the run-up to the much-delayed initial public offering, said two people familiar with the process.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">“The issuer expressed high levels of dissatisfaction with what they were hearing,” said one of these people.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Financiers are increasingly confident of bumper domestic demand at a valuation of $1.8tn or higher, banking on a retail allocation above the 0.5 per cent earmarked in the prospectus. Local investors, some of whom have been pressured to invest, have been encouraged to bid at these higher levels.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">In recent weeks, institutional investors have told bankers that $1.2tn to $1.5tn is more realistic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One thing that Aramco could do with that information would be to go out on the roadshow, try to convince investors, hope to get to $2 trillion and be willing to risk pulling the IPO in shame if it failed. Another thing it could do would be to go out on the roadshow, try to convince investors, hope to get to $2 trillion and be willing to risk pricing at like $1.2 trillion if it failed.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">But the thing that Aramco actually seems to be doing is <em>cancelling </em>much of the international roadshow, giving up on trying to convince big foreign institutions of a $2 trillion valuation, but listing the stock anyway in Saudi Arabia. By “listing the stock anyway” I mean selling a tiny fraction of it to local Saudi investors at a pretty high valuation, with that valuation being driven by some combination of (1) scarcity, (2) local enthusiasm for a national-champion company, (3) <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18645454.128836/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMTcvc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlhLWRvdWJsZXMtYW1vdW50LWJhbmtzLWNhbi1sZW5kLWZvci1hcmFtY28taXBv/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B59766e60" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="Q15RP3DWLU69" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">extra leverage</a> for retail investors and (4) maybe <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18645454.128836/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDktMjAvaXQtcy1oYXJkLXRvLXNheS1uby10by1hcmFtY28tcy1pcG8/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B1b0ceae0" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">implicit threats</a> against rich Saudis who don’t put in orders at a high valuation. <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18645454.128836/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMTgvc2F1ZGktYXJhbWNvLWNhbmNlbHMtbG9uZG9uLWxlZy1vZi1wbGFubmVkLWlwby1yb2Fkc2hvdw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B0d603e98" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">Specifically</a>:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Aramco will sell just 1.5% of its shares on the local stock exchange, about half the amount that had been considered, and seek a valuation of between $1.6 trillion and $1.71 trillion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One possibility is that the deal will price at $1.6 or $1.7 trillion and trade down, and then in a year or so Saudi Arabia will sell more shares to U.S. and European institutions at $1.2 trillion or whatever. But certainly another possibility is that this small 1.5% stub of shares, sold to enthusiastic levered local investors and listed solely on the local exchange, will trade quite well. “With the offer price putting Aramco’s maximum valuation at about $1.7 trillion, there should be room for investors to make some money, said one local investor.”</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">And if it does trade well among local investors for a while, Aramco can go back to the international markets to sell more, and it can point to the existing trading price as a data point. “See, people are buying it at $2 trillion, so you should too,” that sort of thing. I don’t know if that will work; the factors that drive the local price up—scarcity, enthusiasm, threats—won’t work as well if Saudi Arabia sells a bunch more shares to international investors. But a rough theory of “if people see a trading price, they anchor their valuations to that price” does not strike me as crazy. And if you know that big investors aren’t going to pay up now, doing a small tightly controlled listing and seeing what happens doesn’t really cost you much.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">On the other hand, any capital markets banker will tell you that the way to get a high price in a securities offering is to start marketing the securities with a<em> low</em> price, build up a lot of investor enthusiasm, and then raise the price to meet all of that demand. To be clear, the reason that bankers will tell you this is that it makes their job easier: If they market your deal with a low price, then they are more likely to find enough demand to get the deal done, and if they come to you with a deal at that low price you’re going to have a hard time saying no. (You agreed to market the deal at the low price!) The strategy <em>might </em>work as described—they might get so much demand at the low price that they’ll be able to raise the price above what they could have done if they’d just started at a high price—but the real value of the approach, to the bankers, is that it increases the odds of them getting <em>some </em>deal done and getting paid.</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">As the morning wore on and the bids poured in, the price kept rising. By the time terms were set at noon, the discount was virtually gone.</p>

That would also be weird, but … possible? Like presumably the deal team had already done some amount of due diligence on Constellation, and reviewed its books and records and financial accounts and gotten comfortable with what they said, and was not going to be thrown off by the FBI saying “hey some of these companies are a little irregular.” The FBI were just late-coming kibbitzers pointing BofA to public documents; the deal team knew what was up.

<em>[1] From a securities filing perspective in the U.S. it might be annoying to get all the filings right, but I think we can abstract away from that given that we’re really discussing a non-U.S. IPO.</em>

<em>[2] In fact my understanding is that, in the tiny number of prominent U.S. direct listings, *more* stock usually comes loose than in a normal IPO, because a lot of insiders can and do sell immediately rather than being locked up for six months. Bankers seem to think that companies like Spotify and Slack would have traded at higher prices initially if they’d done regular-way IPOs of about 10% of their market cap, rather than letting 15% or more come free in their direct listings. The argument in the text is *possible* for a regular-way U.S. direct listing but maybe not what you’d *expect* in that case. (It’s what I’d expect in the Aramco case though.)</em>
