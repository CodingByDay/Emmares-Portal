<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said that “many investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move.”</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The brokerage doesn’t have the answers to investor queries on who is buying the stock, how high can it go or where there might be support, Jonas wrote in a report to clients Wednesday. … “Folks are asking a lot of questions,” Jonas said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Tesla’s stock finished January (that is, last Friday) at $650.57, up 55.5% from its December close of $418.33, which was itself up 26.8% from November. On Monday, the stock ripped up 19.9% to close at $780. On Tuesday, it got as high as $969 before falling over the last 12 minutes of the trading day and closing at $887.06. Yesterday it fell 17.2% to close at $734.70; it has remained pretty wild today, to the point that I am not going to risk typing a price here. Tesla’s 10-day realized volatility is 170.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">If you bought Tesla stock at any point from its founding up until last Friday, you’ve done great. If you bought, for instance, at the high point after Elon Musk tweeted that he was going to take Tesla private for $420 per share, a tweet that <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMDktMjgvbXVzay1zLXRlc2xhLWZ1bi1kb2VzLW5vdC1hbXVzZS1zZWM/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bab0a636c" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="PFRV2C6JTSE9" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">got him in trouble for securities fraud</a>, and you held through yesterday’s close, you were up about 93.6% over about a year and a half. (By the way, in an alternate universe today’s newsletter is about how Tesla has performed spectacularly since Musk took it private, and how Musk got quite a deal buying it when he did for just $420, and how the SEC is looking into whether his odd behavior was a clever ploy to drive down the stock price so he could get it cheap. But that’s in the alternate universe.)</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">On the other hand if you bought in the last three <em>days </em>… the average price of Tesla stock traded over the first three days of this week was $801.57, according to Bloomberg, about 8.3% above yesterday’s close. This all happened on very heavy volume; Tesla traded about 156.6 million shares ($125.5 billion worth) between Monday and Wednesday. Tesla has about 180.2 million shares outstanding, of which about <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzEzMTg2MDUvMDAwMTQ5NDczMDE5MDAwMDAzL3hzbEYzNDVYMDMvZWRnYXJkb2MueG1s/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bf5efaa23" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">34 million</a> belong to Musk; more than Tesla’s entire free float turned over in the last three days. Of course most of that volume was presumably traded back and forth between a relatively small number of holders, but the tiny theoretical possibility exists that the majority of people now holding Tesla stock have lost money on it. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Why? What happened? There was <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9yZWNvZGUvMjAyMC8yLzQvMjExMjI4ODgvdGVzbGEtc3RvY2staGlnaC1zaG9ydC1zZWxsZXItbW9kZWwteS1lYXJuaW5ncw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bca65d147" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none">good news</a>—strong earnings and guidance, good operational news, enthusiastic support from big shareholders—but for action this wild one wants some sort of technical explanation, preferably a weird one. “The Federal Reserve accidentally bought Tesla instead of Treasuries,” that would be a good one, something you could sink your teeth into. I don’t have one. (I don’t think it’s that.)</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One obvious place to look is <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJhZ2NhcC5jb20vd2h5LWlzLXNob3J0aW5nLXN0b2Nrcy1zby1kaWZmaWN1bHQv/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B61fd08f9" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">short sellers</a>: Tesla is a very heavily shorted stock and Musk loves to fight with short sellers, so it would be satisfying if <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjAtMDItMDUvYmlnLXNob3J0LXMtZWlzbWFuLWVuZHMtYmV0LWFnYWluc3QtdGVzbGEtY2FsbGluZy1pdC1jdWx0LWxpa2U/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B9c9e2f2b" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="Q588JZDWRGG1" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">short sellers capitulated</a> and were forced to buy in their shorts, driving the price higher.

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Yes, there’s an entrenched short base that’s getting torched, but this doesn’t explain the velocity or magnitude of this move.

</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">And <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly9paHNtYXJraXQuY29tL3Jlc2VhcmNoLWFuYWx5c2lzL3doby13b3VsZC1zaG9ydC10ZXNsYS5odG1s/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B80bd7f5a" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">IHS Markit points out</a> that Tesla’s short interest hasn’t actually changed that much in recent weeks. That’s complicated by the fact that Tesla has convertible bonds outstanding: Convertible arbitrageurs tend to sell stock short to hedge their long convertible positions, and when the stock goes <em>up </em>they tend to sell <em>more </em>stock. So even as outright short sellers are getting squeezed, their short positions are being replaced by convertible arbitrageurs who are shorting more stock. <em>This</em>, in turn, is complicated by the fact that Tesla has “call spreads” in connection with its convertibles, in which it effectively bought back the conversion option from investment banks and sold them another, higher-strike option.[1] The hedge for this is more complicated; generally the banks will buy<em> </em>stock to hedge initially, but if the stock goes up as far as Tesla’s has they will probably switch to selling.[2] So probably in the recent action:</p>
<ol style="margin: 1em 0; list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 40px">
<li style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 5px">Outright short sellers have been capitulating and buying as the stock goes up.</li>
<li style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 5px">Convertible arbitrageurs have been selling short as it goes up (and buying as it goes down).</li>
<li style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 5px">Tesla’s investment banks have been selling as it goes up (and buying as it goes down).</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">You might expect the overall result of this to be <em>less </em>volatility rather than more, so it does not seem to have much explanatory power. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Another place to look is call options.

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Shares in the electric-car maker have soared more than 60% in six days to top $900 for the first time. Options traders who held calls that pay out at $800 have done even better, after they jumped from 25 cents to close at $24.22 Monday. The $1,000 calls rose from 2 cents to $1.98, a surge of 9,800%.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The fortunes allegedly minted via Tesla options have, naturally, corresponded with a surge in their popularity. The 10-day average call option volume more than doubled since early December, as has the underlying security. On Monday, 1.8 Tesla calls traded for every S&amp;P 500 call, the biggest gap on record according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">There’s an element of circularity at play, but this activity may be contributing to the rally in the shares. When a trader buys a call, the dealer who sells it will typically buy a certain amount of stock in the underlying to offset their exposure. If the shares continue to rise, dynamically managing that hedge can entail increasing purchases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">If you assume, reasonably, that most of the action in Tesla calls involves unhedged buyers (speculators, regular people) and hedged sellers (dealers, market makers), then the call options should have a volatility-increasing effect: Dealers who sell call options have to buy stock to hedge, and they have to buy more stock to adjust their hedge as the stock goes up (and sell as it goes down), meaning that speculators who buy Tesla call options to bet on the price and volatility going up also to some extent cause that to happen. To some extent! “LOL BLOOMBERG ADMITTING THAT AS LONG AS WE BUY THE CALLS THE STOCKS WILL GO UP BECAUSE OF HEDGING ALGORITHMS,” was <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL3dhbGxzdHJlZXRiZXRzL2NvbW1lbnRzL2V5dmNxeS9sb2xfYmxvb21iZXJnX2FkbWl0dGluZ190aGF0X2FzX2xvbmdfYXNfd2VfYnV5Lw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B11cadf40" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Reddit’s</a> <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS93b2xmZWpvc2gvc3RhdHVzLzEyMjQ4OTYzNTM1ODQ1NzQ0NjYvcGhvdG8vMQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B6e597c43" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">takeaway</a> from Kawa’s article, and I would not personally go that far. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">There is however an element of truth to it, which is that call options are a <em>levered </em>way to bet on a stock. On Friday, you could have spent $266 to buy the $800-strike call options and get exposure to $65,000 worth of stock; the dealer might have hedged that by buying about $4,550 worth of stock, and then buying more as the stock went up.[3] If a lot of people get excited about a stock all at once, and they put all their money into buying the stock, it will go up. If a lot of people get excited about a stock all at once, and they put all their money into buying the stock, and then they <em>borrow more money </em>to buy more stock, then it will go up even more. Options, same basic idea. Also of course if they borrow money to bet on the stock and things go poorly, they will lose more money and the stock will crash faster, etc., this is all <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9vbC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2dlbmVyYWwvMjAxMy8wOS8wMy93aGF0LXdhcy1iZWhpbmQtdGhlLXdvcnN0LWNyYXNoLWluLWhpc3RvcnkuYXNweA/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B504641eb" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">standard stuff</a> when the leverage is from margin loans, and options aren't so different.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But the main point is probably not so much the leverage but the excitement. <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMC8wMi8wNC90ZXNsYS1pcy1iZWNvbWluZy1hLW9uZS1zdG9jay1tYW5pYS5odG1s/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115C3170ff15" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Santoli</a>:</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">There’s over-eager retail flow, for sure. There’s been a huge rush of new investors buying at over $700 a share via Robinhood in the past day. On Monday, 12,000 Robinhood accounts bought it for the first time. It’s a one-stock mania.

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">In a sign of just how the electric car-maker’s manic rally was spreading FOMO across the globe, typing the phrase “should I” into a Google search returned “should I buy Tesla stock?” as the very first autocomplete prediction. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Assuming, as I do, that Google knows us better than we know ourselves, the implication here is that the modal desire of a (U.S., English-speaking) person this week is to buy Tesla stock. Of all the things you could do, or at least of all the things you could ask Google about, that’s number one. “Google,” you say, “my life is in your hands, tell me what actions are most appropriate for a human in this fallen world,” and Google is like “it’s Tesla, buy Tesla, that’s the secret.”</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Of course if everyone is going around thinking about Tesla, that will probably make the stock go up. Also of course if everyone who bought the stock did so on their phones, after casually asking Google, they might not be the most committed long-term investors. “Wait I thought Google told me to buy this stock and now it’s going down? I’m outta here.” </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">My favorite explanation is IHS Markit’s conclusion to its note about short sellers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">One final answer, which may be the most significant going forward: Increased long positions on the part of investors excited about the dawn of the electric car age are likely playing a role, as they have over the nearly ten years since the company went public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">“People like the stock and want to buy it” is the weakest possible answer, sure, but it’s also the only really good one.</p>

The best time for us to trade is when everyone else wants to trade, and in this era of computers and wires and so forth it is not hard for us all to coordinate on some brief window when we can all get our trading done. A half hour is plenty of time for everyone who wants to buy or sell stock to do so; the other six hours are just for old time’s sake, and for hanging around in case something weird happens.

Walk the dog! “Too many people waste their talents going into stock trading instead of brain surgery,” the popular critique of the financial industry goes, but what if the real problem is that too many stock traders waste their talents trading stocks all day instead of in brief intense bursts? They could take up brain surgery with the other six hours, I don’t know.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I am not sure how serious I am about any of this. Obviously there is something good about having an always-on, or even always-on-during-normal-business-hours, market; it allows prices to incorporate information in real time and react to events in other markets, and it allows people to respond to changing circumstances by buying and selling assets when they want or need to. You’d be sad if ATMs only worked half an hour a day. If you’re someone who manages money in the stock market, temporal flexibility is a good thing. I am just saying that walking the dog is a good thing too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Across Europe, 74% of finance professionals, including traders, analysts and fund managers, said they favor reducing the current 8 1/2-hour stock market day -- which exceeds the U.S. by two hours.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The results of the survey lend weight to a proposal by two professional bodies to shorten market hours for reasons including the concentration of liquidity in the first and last hours of trading, the short time window between corporate news releases and the market open, and the need to improve the work-life balance and diversity at financial firms. The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) and the Investment Association of U.K. asset managers asked bourses in November to consider cutting 90 minutes from their trading day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">There are market-structure arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">“Making trading hours shorter will improve market efficiency,” said Matthew McLoughlin, a London-based partner and head of trading at Liontrust Investment Partners LLP and a member of the Investment Association’s buy-side trading committee. “There’s no benefit in spreading liquidity out over a longer period than necessary.” …</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But there are also, better, human-flourishing arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">London’s 8 a.m. market start means most traders need to be at the office by 6 a.m., making it more challenging for parents with young children to work as traders because it’s “impossible” to find childcare at 5 a.m., Liontrust’s McLoughlin said. The long hours and early start also deter recent university graduates from going into equity trading because they can instead work for technology firms that offer flexible hours and a work-life balance, he said.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Shorter sessions “could help change the perception of the industry with different generations, which could in turn, help attract people who wouldn’t normally consider a career in asset management,” said Louise Drummond, deputy global head of investment execution at Aberdeen Standard Investments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Yes, good, I am on board, my only objection is that cutting 90 minutes seems too timid, just roll in at noon, trade for an hour over lunch and go home, this is a great financial innovation, get it done. Do it for bond trading too. <em>Do it for M&amp;A</em>. If you want to buy or sell your company, show up at the London Mergers Exchange at noon on Wednesday and wait an hour to see if there are any takers; if there aren’t, go home. Take the weekends off. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Financial markets are coordination games, mechanisms to get buyers and sellers in the same place at the same time. In the olden days that meant hitching up your horse to travel to the fair, and the fair had to run for like a week to make sure everyone’s horse made it. With modern technology everyone can, without too much trouble, show up at the same electronic matching engine in the same 30-second window. Or, you know, with modern technology, “the same place” can be “everywhere” and “the same time” can be “always.” That is sort of the default expectation, but it isn’t <em>necessary.</em> You could also just use the technology to get everyone to meet for five minutes a week to transact their business and then go do something more fun.</p>

Opacity, structuring, everyone being on every side of every transaction at once: Those are characteristics of the industry, not unique to WeWork.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">For instance! At the Financial Times, Mark Vandevelde has a <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/19372994.138988/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvNTk1YTc3ZDAtMzg2Ny0xMWVhLWE2ZDMtOWEyNmY4YzNjYmE0/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bfdeff74c" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; border-bottom: 1px solid black; background-color: bisque; text-decoration: none"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">profile of the Brookfield real estate empire</a>, and while you will not exactly come away from the profile with an understanding of that empire, you will at least gain an understanding of why it is so hard to understand. For instance here’s a trade in which Brookfield bought some assets from Brookfield:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">More precisely, the buyer was BAM [<em>Brookfield Asset Management</em>], which sits a few rows from the top of the Brookfield triangle, and is sometimes known as Brookfield for short. This was already unusual: when the Brookfield group buys an asset, the money usually comes from one of the investment funds it runs for outside investors. “BAM doesn’t do anything,” Mr Flatt [<em>Brookfield Chief Executive Officer Bruce Flatt</em>] confirms. “BAM never puts up any money, for anything. That’s why, if you’ve read any of our materials, we’re increasingly at the point where we generate way more cash than we need.”</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">But this time BAM was in fact putting up money, to buy a 28 per cent stake in a bunch of New York office towers. And it was doing more besides. The buildings were owned by Brookfield Property Partners, a separate Nasdaq-listed company that sits further down the triangle, trades under the ticker BPY and — confusingly — is also sometimes known as Brookfield for short. Because BPY does not employ any property specialists, it delegates tasks such as identifying assets to buy and sell to other parts of the Brookfield empire. As well as snapping up the New York office tower stakes, therefore, BAM was steering BPY to get rid of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">A publicly traded asset manager buying assets from the publicly traded fund that it manages: Sure it’s odd, but in the real estate industry the proper reaction is a resigned shrug. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Still Brookfield is a little special in that it is controlled by an entity called Partners Limited, whose “40 members own about one-fifth of BAM, but have enough votes to appoint nine of its 16 directors.” And BAM in turn manages assets for BPY and other outside investors and entities. So you have a small semi-secret group (“The identity of some of those ‘partners’ is not clear”) of people who control a public company most of whose capital comes from outsiders, and that company in turn runs further companies with further outside capital, so you have some $500 billion in assets indirectly controlled by a small group of people with a relatively modest economic stake. Or in technical terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Those insiders wield such power that the companies below them could face risks similar to those of “pyramid control companies”, according to a draft investor disclosure that Brookfield filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2013. (The final version warned instead of risks “associated with a separation of economic interest from control”.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">“Pyramid”: a perfectly good word of geometric description, a word that usefully characterizes certain complicated and legitimate managerial structures, but not a word you want in your SEC filings if you can avoid it.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Also this is fun: </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">In one puzzling dispute, a departing executive filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Mr Flatt’s brother Gordon, who has no apparent connection to Brookfield. (The litigation took place in Bermuda and few details are public, but Gordon Flatt denied the allegations against him, and a knowledgeable person said the case had been settled.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">In the world of real estate sometimes you have to sue the CEO’s brother for no particular reason, that is just how it’s done.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">Vanguard Group is launching a private-equity fund, a striking move for the money manager that built a brand on the back of low-cost funds for everyday investors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">On the other hand it makes pretty straightforward sense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">The new fund is part of Chief Executive Tim Buckley’ s push to broaden the Malvern, Pa.-based company’s appeal as a financial adviser for larger investors. With Mr. Buckley at the helm, the firm with $6.2 trillion in assets under management has pressed beyond the index-fund business it is best known for and further into the advisory business. It has also added more actively managed funds to its financial lineup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">It has become more or less conventional wisdom, for a lot of big investors, that the bulk of your portfolio should be in low-cost indexed investments and a smaller chunk should be in expensive uncorrelated alternatives. That is good for Vanguard, since it gets to manage most of those investors’ money, but why not shoot for all of it? If 80% of your money is in index funds at Vanguard, why not keep things simple and get your alternatives through Vanguard too?</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 1em 0">I suppose in the long run everyone will be a giant full-service financial supermarket but it’s probably harder for a private equity manager to build a huge index business than the reverse. Easier to start with 80% and try to capture the other 20% than the reverse.</p>

<em>[2] IHS Markit: “One factor which may have influenced the share price over the recent rally is short exposure to call options. Historically, when Tesla sold convertible bonds, they also purchased calls at the conversion price and simultaneously sold warrants with higher strike prices. The stated purpose for these transactions was to reduce the impact of dilution should the share price exceed the conversion price at maturity, as Tesla could effectively buy back shares in the market with the proceeds of the profitable call option that they purchased. That antidilutive measure would only hold up to the strike price of the warrants that Tesla sold to offset the cost of the call option. As noted in the prospectus for the 1.25% 2021 convertibles: ‘However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of Common Stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates.’ The strike price for those warrants is $560 per share. In considering all potential forces driving the Tesla share price higher, hedging activity related to the calls Tesla purchased, and potentially Tesla hedging the warrants, which it in turn sold, may be playing a role.” The banks sold Tesla call options with relatively low strike prices and bought back options with high strike prices. As the stock goes up, the delta on the low-strike options goes up faster than the delta on the high-strike options, so the banks have to buy more stock to hedge the options they sold. But as it goes *way* up, the delta on the low-strike options approaches 100% and the delta on the high-strike options starts moving faster, so the banks have to sell stock to hedge the options they bought. </em>

<em>[3] That is, the $800-strike February options traded at $2.66 against a closing price of $650.57 for the stock; options contracts are for 100 shares. The dealer wouldn’t buy all 100 shares; it would buy the delta, but even that gets a leveraged exposure. Bloomberg’s OV calculator tells me that on Friday, when the  $800-strike February call was trading in the $2.66 area, it had a delta of about 7%. A dealer who sold you the option on 100 shares would hedge by buying about 7 shares, or about $4,550 worth of stock, while you’re only putting up $266. Also the delta went up on Monday and Tuesday, so the dealer was buying more.</em>
