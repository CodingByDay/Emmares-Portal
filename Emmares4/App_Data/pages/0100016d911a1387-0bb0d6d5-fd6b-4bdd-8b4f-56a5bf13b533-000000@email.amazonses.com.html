It resembles the dual-screen Surface Neo, except that its displays are smaller. Each display is 5.6 inches and can rotate 360 degrees, allowing it to unfold into an 8.3-inch tablet mode. The displays can run different apps at the same time, or one of the displays can be used as a keyboard or game controller. Some details on the phone are unknown, such as whether the device will have a rear camera. The device will be out during the holidays in 2020.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fgoogle-begins-rolling-out-incognito-mode-for-maps-1838699332/1/0100016d911a1387-0bb0d6d5-fd6b-4bdd-8b4f-56a5bf13b533-000000/PQp5HzcUqxYh5VSheNvyAtMEvdEoFc_jtNyZXrWJPbk=109" target="_blank">Google Begins Rolling Out Incognito Mode for Maps (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Google has started to roll out Incognito mode for its Maps app. In-app activity won't be saved when using Incognito mode to browse. Google has been rolling out a lengthy list of tools around privacy and transparency since May. An auto-delete feature which allows users to automatically remove their location and activity data from their Google Account after a period of time will be expanding to YouTube this week. Users can ask Google Assistant for information on how Google handles its data. Google Assistant can also now delete data within certain timeframes when asked to do so. A Password Checkup tool is available that allows users to run a security scan on their usernames and passwords to check for potentially compromised credentials.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F10%2F1%2F20891868%2F3d-printing-rockets-relativity-space-stargate-terran-1-rocket-funding-launch/1/0100016d911a1387-0bb0d6d5-fd6b-4bdd-8b4f-56a5bf13b533-000000/Y8WlqqqTysuUxp5aXngDkEaXxfJA_36HR1mzlSSjAHE=109" target="_blank">Startup that aims to 3D-print rockets says it’s fully funded for its first commercial missions (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Relativity Space, a startup that aims to launch the first fully 3D-printed rocket into orbit, has announced that it has reached its funding goals and that the first commercial operations will begin in early 2021. By using 3D printing to create its rockets, Relativity Space can drastically cut down on costs by requiring fewer parts per rocket. The company hopes to replicate the 3D printing process on other planets. Its first rocket, the Terran 1, is a small-to-medium-sized vehicle that will stand about 100 feet tall and be able to carry up to 2,755 lbs. Relativity Space plans to increase its payload limits. The first Terran 1 rocket will be launched at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2Ff%2F614450%2Fputin-could-decide-for-the-world-on-crispr-babies%2F/1/0100016d911a1387-0bb0d6d5-fd6b-4bdd-8b4f-56a5bf13b533-000000/EM0wr1FquOicwNLm4JUrYJNm0gQ7yxlItTbUkhLUK1I=109" target="_blank">Putin could decide for the world on CRISPR babies (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A secret summit has been held in Moscow between government health officials to debate a bid by a scientist to create genetically modified babies. The first genetically modified humans were born in China last year as a part of a project to create HIV-resistant humans. Putin's eldest daughter, Maria Vorontsova, was present at the secret summit. Scientists want official rules to be set for gene editing, but it is undecided who should control the genetically modified future. The costs of gene editing are dropping and is currently around $15,500, the cost of a car. There is plenty of potential in the technology, but it can be easily abused. </p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkaxap%2Farl%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FREADME.md/1/0100016d911a1387-0bb0d6d5-fd6b-4bdd-8b4f-56a5bf13b533-000000/vYUsf4IVEHnOXm9tI04PPvdii4xYWvw-oO3WilqmFns=109" target="_blank">ARL (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">This repository contains a list of the most popular repositories, sorted by the number of stars, for each of the most favored programming languages.

Now Some Believe That Was Bad Advice (10 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Public health officials have long been urging Americans to limit the consumption of red and processed meats due to its links with heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. Researchers have recently revealed that the advice was not backed by good scientific evidence. Large studies have found little health benefits from eating less beef and pork. Some scientists have criticized these studies, saying that it is irresponsible to publish results that may harm peoples' health. There is a growing awareness of the environmental impact of the meat industry. Red meat consumption has fallen since 1970, and has largely been replaced by poultry.</p> <br><br>
