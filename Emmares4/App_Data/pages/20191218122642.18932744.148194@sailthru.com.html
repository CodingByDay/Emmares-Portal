I don’t really know what to think about the Vision Fund, which is run by SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son. I make fun of it around here sometimes, because it is funny. The story has more funny anecdotes to make fun of. But it’s not obvious that the Vision Fund is <em>bad</em>. Like, at investing. It has some hits and some misses. The current mark to market on WeWork is terrible, but maybe it’ll all work out and the story will be that SoftBank was bold and brilliant in buying WeWork cheap because the public didn’t want it. Uber seems to be <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18932744.148194/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAxOS8wOS8wMy9zb2Z0YmFuay1tb3JlLXRoYW4tNjAwLW1pbGxpb24tdW5kZXJ3YXRlci1vbi11YmVyLmh0bWw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B08534d32" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">another black eye</a>. But there have been some nice wins. Overall returns for the fund seem to be positive.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">It would be sort of satisfying, after months of making fun of WeWork, to read that the Vision Fund is a disaster and no one there knows what they’re doing. But that’s not quite the lesson of this story; the fund has lots of sophisticated investment professionals, and it’s not all a disaster. It’s just all … weird. It’s sort of random. There’s no theme:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The strategy that Son and his all-male phalanx of managing partners followed seemed less about any specific technology than about placing large bets on the buzziest startups: WeWork ($10.7 billion), Uber ($7.7 billion), on-demand pizza maker Zume ($375 million), and dog-walking app Wag ($300 million). They invested in a few hardcore artificial intelligence companies, too.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The companies are goofy:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">After Vision Fund invested $375 million in Zume Pizza Inc., whose mission to use robots to automate pizza making had shades of Silicon Valley frivolity, CEO Alex Garden expanded his mission to include rethinking the entirety of U.S. food production. Employees were unnerved. “Are we the next Theranos?” went one anonymously submitted question at an all-hands meeting over the summer. Afterward, Zume banned anonymous questions at the meetings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The investment process is haphazard:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">One Silicon Valley CEO recalls an early pitch meeting with Son over video chat. Unbeknownst to the CEO, the feed to Tokyo fell a minute behind the audio, so he was narrating slides SoftBank’s top brass weren’t yet seeing. “They were all superpolite and nodding their heads,” said a person with knowledge of the meeting, who wasn’t authorized to discuss it. “I didn’t find out until after that none of it made any sense.” The fund ultimately invested in the late-stage startup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The performance reviews are salad-focused:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Masa has been convening his top people to discuss the company’s missteps. One such meeting, at Son’s Woodside compound, featured a tasting session with lettuce and kale from Plenty, a SoftBank-backed vertical farming startup. The produce was judged on “flavor notes and mouthfeel and finish,” says one managing partner who attended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Why does it work? I feel like the way asset allocators are supposed to choose their investment managers is by asking a lot of questions about strategy and process and due diligence and repeatability of results. And then Masayoshi Son went to Saudi Arabia and was like “well sometimes I can’t follow a company’s pitch because the audio is garbled but I invest anyway because they have good energy” or whatever, and then the Saudis gave him $45 billion. What is the <em>strategy </em>here? What is the source of alpha? Why would you let Son make your investment decisions rather than flipping a coin, when his decisions always seem so … coin-flippy?</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I don’t know. Part of the answer might be a sort of undefinable connoisseurship; Son really has picked some huge winners in the past, and perhaps he has seen enough successes, and has a sharp enough ability to recognize patterns, that he can meet founders for five minutes and correctly intuit whether they will change the world. Part of the answer—the answer often mentioned by competing venture capitalists, and also sort of SoftBank’s official answer—is that having $100 billion gives you an unfair advantage in venture investing:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">But the real strategy behind the Vision Fund seems to involve another Masa principle: Big money means big strategic advantages. The idea is that festooning entrepreneurs with hundreds of millions of dollars and urging them to spend at an exorbitant pace will scare off competitors and allow the Vision Fund to mint behemoths. No one “wants to pick a fight with a crazy guy,” he told Bloomberg Businessweek last year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I wonder though if part of it is that Son is particularly good at motivating founders. If the Vision Fund is short on process and organization, and long on Son’s personal charisma, maybe that’s a good thing for the founders that it funds. Maybe they will work harder and dream bigger and do better things if they think “I have been anointed by a mad genius” rather than, like, “my five-year financial projections have been approved by a committee.” And the anointment is intense:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Many SoftBank-backed founders have Masa stories. These often begin with a summons to the 26th floor of SoftBank’s green-tinted glass headquarters in Tokyo or to Son’s home in Woodside, Calif., a 74-acre compound whose massive main residence features a foyer with a large marble statue of a horse and chariot. The entrepreneur might then sit across a table from Son, answer a few questions, hear that their idea is even more promising than they thought, and, by the end of the conversation, be anointed “the next Jack Ma.”</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">“You feel enabled, you feel euphoric,” says a chief executive officer in Asia. “You’ve been told no a hundred times, and then he says he believes in you. Every entrepreneur dreams of having that kind of backing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Classically the model of venture capital investing is that you invest in a lot of startups, and most of them fail, but a few change the world and return your entire fund. One requirement of that model is that you have to invest only in companies that <em>might </em>change the world, companies with big risks but big ambition, and those companies are hard to find. Perhaps Son’s innovation is that people come to him with self-evidently small-scale ideas like “we’ll let you hire a dog walker online” or “we’ll use robots to make pizzas,” and he just <em>tells them </em>that they’ll change the world. And they believe him, and they feel enabled and euphoric and, who knows, maybe some of them go out and do it. Perhaps Son has an unusual ability to increase the number of big bets in his portfolio, by convincing those around him that their ideas actually can be big bets.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The downside is not just that some of those bets won’t work out—which is generally true in venture investing—but also that, when they don’t work out, the mismatch between their ambitions and the reality will always be embarrassing. “We are a community company committed to maximum global impact,” <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18932744.148194/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE1MzM1MjMvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTE5MjIwNDk5L2Q3ODE5ODJkczEuaHRt/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B7996905a" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">began the prospectus</a> for WeWork’s failed initial public offering, though by that point WeWork was so grandiose that it had changed its name to “The We Company.” Well, no, it turns out you were an office real estate company. But for a little while Son got them to believe the story about maximum global impact. Maybe that’s what he does.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 21px; line-height: 28px; font-weight: bold; Margin-bottom: 18px; Margin-top: 18px">Enchanted Forest review</h2>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Again, the basic traditional model of venture investing is that you invest in a lot of startups, and some of them fail, and some succeed and go public and make up for the failures. This contrasts to the basic model of public stock investing, which is that you invest in a lot of stocks, and some of them go up and some go down, but the performances are sort of normally distributed around the average market return. The typical result of a startup investment is either losing all your money or returning a multiple of it; the typical result of a mature public-company investment is that you get a bit more than your money back.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The Wall Street Journal has a <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18932744.148194/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9hLWRlY2FkZS1vZi11bmljb3Jucy1lbmRzLXdpdGgtYS1saXR0bGUtbGVzcy1tYWdpYy0xMTU3NjYzMDgwMT9tb2Q9c2VhcmNocmVzdWx0cyZwYWdlPTEmcG9zPTE/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B9938df1f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">fascinating package of charts</a> on “a decade of unicorns,” the billion-dollar-plus private tech companies that rose to prominence, and then often did initial public offerings, this decade. The most interesting chart, to me, was the first one, comparing “final private-market rounds, initial public offerings and market cap at end of IPO year” of the decade’s unicorns. Unicorns that went public between 2015 and 2019 were valued at $203.7 billion in their final private funding rounds, and $211.4 billion at the end of the years in which they went public.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Now going from $203.7 billion to $211.4 billion is not great. (The S&amp;P 500 Index has averaged more than a 9% annual growth over those five years.) But notice that this measure only counts <em>unicorns that went public </em>during that period. This measure <em>only counts the successes</em>. If you invested in the final private round of those unicorns, <em>and they went public</em>, you got a bit more than your money back. That’s the <em>good </em>outcome; you invested in a pre-IPO company and it successfully IPOed. And you made like 4%.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The key point here is that if you invested in 10 startups, and nine of them failed, and the one that succeeded went up 4%, then that would be a catastrophe. But of course those are not the economics of unicorns, or of “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18932744.148194/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMjMvaG93LWRvLXlvdS1saWtlLXdlLW5vdw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B46bc2726" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="PZU4F46JTSE8" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">FPOs</a>,” as final private offerings are called these days. If you are investing in the final private round of a multibillion-dollar venture-backed tech company, you are not expecting a venture-like return profile. You are not making big risky bets, hoping for a few big successes to make up for a bunch of total write-offs. You are just buying stock in a mature stable company. You hope the stock will go up a bit.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One thing that I often say around here is that “private markets are the new public markets”: Private companies can now achieve multibillion-dollar valuations and global household-name status while raising billions of dollars from traditional public-market investors, all before going public. This chart is a great illustration of the other side of it: Big private tech companies, in the late 2010s, were just <em>valued like </em>public companies. There was no expectation of huge returns to make up for huge risk. They were public companies already, even though they were still private. They just sold stock.</p>

However, companies with a need for capital may explore ways to raise capital prior to, or shortly after, the direct listing event.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Companies considering a capital raise prior to a direct listing may complete a traditional private placement of convertible preferred stock shortly prior to the direct listing. In addition, such companies may also consider issuing convertible notes that convert into common stock of the company in connection with a direct listing or IPO. These can be structured to convert (or become convertible) into common stock based on the trading price of the common stock on the exchange. Similar to convertible notes issued by early stage companies in a seed financing or bridge financing, this alternative allows the company and the investors to defer a valuation until the applicable liquidity event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The convertible notes idea is essentially: You find some investors to buy your stock from you shortly before the direct listing, you sell them stock at a price to be determined later, and that price is determined by your trading price after the direct listing. You get some of the benefits of the IPO (mainly raising money, but also selling your stock to specific investors chosen by you), but you also get the main benefit of the direct listing: The price of your stock is determined by the market, not by negotiations with the big initial investors.</p>

As alleged in the complaint, until he was terminated earlier this year, Nellore traded Palo Alto Networks securities based on the confidential information or tipped his friends, Sivannarayana Barama, Ganapathi Kunadharaju, Saber Hussain, and Prasad Malempati, who also traded.  </p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The SEC’s complaint alleges that the defendants sought to evade detection, with Nellore insisting that the ring use the code word “baby” in texts and emails to refer to his employer’s stock, and advising they “exit baby,” or “enter few baby.” The complaint also alleges that certain traders kicked back trading profits to Nellore in small cash transactions intended to avoid bank scrutiny and reporting requirements. After the FBI interviewed Nellore about the trading in May, he purchased one-way tickets to India for himself and his family and was arrested at the airport.</p>

<em>[1] I’m being a little loose here, and there are some actual parallels. The way it works is that if you are a government official asking for a bribe, or a corporate insider conveying inside information, there is no good way to do that in writing, no neutral bland way to do it that you can later explain as a legitimate transaction. But further down the chain there are good and bad ways to do euphemism. If you’re a local consultant telling a banker that he needs to wire you some money to bribe government officials, you say “corporate marketing fees” rather than “chickens” (or “bribe money”). And if you’re a trader who got an inside tip and wants to share it with your trader buddies, you say “I did some fundamental research and spent time on Yahoo Finance message boards and think this stock is a strong buy,” or whatever, rather than “I’ve got a hot insider tip” or “enter baby.” In either case there are plausible legitimate and illegitimate explanations for what you’re doing, and you want your written descriptions to have a veneer of legitimacy. </em>
