Tesla shares had dropped 6.1 percent after the Cybertruck's unveiling due to an embarrassing hiccup. The windows of the truck were shattered while Musk was demonstrating its durability. Tesla has done no advertising or paid endorsements for the truck, with the demand coming only from its unveiling. No date has been given for Cybertruck's release. Its design has been a topic of concern for some analysts. The development of a pickup truck means that carrying heavier loads over long distances using battery technology is now practical.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fgoogle-cloud-print-shutdown-date%2F/1/0100016ea2422e11-f3b32507-bb9a-40ee-ab3e-b4ca299eef23-000000/OGNqL-9oiyHmzxm5gZ3jRVDmtMO-xY_kg_sHilC-S2I=116" target="_blank">Google Cloud Print follows Reader and Inbox to the trash heap after 2020 (1 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Google Cloud Print will be shutting down at the end of 2020.

Native printer support on Chrome OS has been improved, but Cloud Print is still used by many to link their devices to their printers. Google has been known to kill some of its projects after a few years.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Felon-musk-jeff-bezos-help-space-kingdom-asgardia-2019%2F/1/0100016ea2422e11-f3b32507-bb9a-40ee-ab3e-b4ca299eef23-000000/aNm5arw3JGRxWRHgVK3tdthdCJnoaK1_IHBRZrKCMY4=116" target="_blank">A self-declared space nation called Asgardia is planning a fully functioning space economy and wants help from Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The Space Kingdom of Asgardia is a project to set up a nation that exists entirely in space. It currently has more than 300,000 members paying its residency fees and a parliament of 150 elected representatives. Asgardia aims to transport people to a space station by 2043 in order to build a new democratic society. The space nation has considered approaching Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos in order to help them to get into outer space. Asgardia aims to be a fully functioning and independent society, with its own constitution, national symbols, laws, and currency. It was founded in 2016 by billionaire Russian scientist and politician Igor Ashurbeyli, who has invested $12 million of his own money into the project to date. Asgardia plans to take a neutral stance on all Earthly matters.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Fsections%2Fgoatsandsoda%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2F781596238%2Finfecting-mosquitoes-with-bacteria-could-have-a-big-payoff/1/0100016ea2422e11-f3b32507-bb9a-40ee-ab3e-b4ca299eef23-000000/EIn1yHlfZRYj-5PGv4mkmNjEkV_0kI5--hPznQsUHZg=116" target="_blank">Infecting Mosquitoes With Bacteria Could Have A Big Payoff (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Last year, nearly 400 million people experienced dengue, a painful viral disease. An outbreak throughout Southeast Asia is guaranteed every rainy season. Previous efforts to control outbreaks have involved trapping infected mosquitoes. The World Mosquito Program is cultivating and releasing mosquitoes that have been infected with a bacterium called Wolbachia. Wolbachia occurs naturally in many insects, but it is not common in the mosquitoes that carry dengue. The bacterium can be passed down to future generations. It stops the mosquitoes from transmitting arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika. A 75 percent reduction in dengue cases was seen in communities where the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were released. The WMP deployed the infected mosquitoes in Brazil and saw a 70-75 percent reduction in cases of chikungunya. It is theoretically possible to use Wolbachia to wipe out dengue entirely.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.diagram.codes%2F/1/0100016ea2422e11-f3b32507-bb9a-40ee-ab3e-b4ca299eef23-000000/RcFcQJS-ZKKlg2I92ZFd7AO3ZKW9rsWWL11YprVhGK0=116" target="_blank">Diagram generation tool (Website)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The Diagram generation tool allows users to describe diagrams with a simple text language and automatically generate an exportable image.

A programmer with five years of experience has more industry tenure than half of the entire industry. Copying and pasting code is bad practice as it introduces bugs and potentially increases the work required in the future. Less code is better than more code, as each line of code can introduce potential problems. A developer should always try to verify knowledge on their own rather than always relying on senior developers. Test-driven development, while seemingly cumbersome and unnatural, can result in much cleaner and high-quality code. A programmer should always be collecting evidence in order to be able to make technical and business cases for courses of action, as this ensures a good career.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2Ftravel%2Farticle%2Flivestream-hotel-room-japan-intl-hnk%2Findex.html/1/0100016ea2422e11-f3b32507-bb9a-40ee-ab3e-b4ca299eef23-000000/rsW38OusqSQQshjyVVh_f6IcL8vwSXkIAAyZ0Ojo6As=116" target="_blank">This Japanese hotel room costs $1 a night. The catch? You have to livestream your stay (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A hotel in the Japanese city of Fukuoka allows guests to have the option of paying around $1 per night if they agree to have their entire stay live-streamed. The stream is video-only, so guests will have privacy in their conversations or phone calls. Guests can turn the lights off, and the bathroom area is out of camera range. There have been four guests who have taken up the offer so far, and the hotel's YouTube channel has now passed 1,000 subscribers. The channel will be monetized once it accumulates more than 4,000 view hours. When the room is vacant or not streaming, the owner will post a live stream of himself working in the office. Fukuoka is one of CNN Travel's must-visit destinations for 2019. The city is known for its incredible food.</p> <br><br>
