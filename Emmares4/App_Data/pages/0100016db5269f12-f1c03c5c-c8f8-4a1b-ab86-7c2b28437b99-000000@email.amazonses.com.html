Included with the release will be a pair of AR glasses that Apple has developed with third-party brands. The new, lower-cost iPhone SE 2 and a new iPad Pro will also be released. A 5G iPhone is set to be released in the third quarter of 2020. Kuo did not mention the 16-inch MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, which was supposed to launch sometime this month. The new iPhone SE 2 will use the same A13 chip as the iPhone 11 and have a similar design to the iPhone 8. It should cost around $399.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2019%2Foct%2F09%2Fprotecting-rioters-china-warns-apple-over-app-that-tracks-hong-kong-police/1/0100016db5269f12-f1c03c5c-c8f8-4a1b-ab86-7c2b28437b99-000000/EFrNeF6pzSksQ0934SPgpaRSL6_aft2RzpSagT4QEOw=110" target="_blank">'Protecting rioters': China warns Apple over app that tracks Hong Kong police (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">China has accused Apple of endorsing and protecting protestors in Hong Kong because of an app in its App Store that tracks the movement of police in the city. HKmap.live is an app that crowdsources the location of police and anti-government protestors and displays the information as hotspots on a map. It was originally rejected by Apple, but the decision was reversed and it was approved on October 4. The app is the most downloaded app in the iOS App Store under the Travel category for Hong Kong. People's Daily, a Chinese Communist party mouthpiece, has criticized Apple's decision to distribute the app and allowing an unofficial anthem sung by protestors to be available for download in the Apple Music store. The protests are now in their 18th week. China has targeted other foreign companies over their support of Hong Kong's protestors, including NBA's Houston Rockets and Tiffany &amp; Co.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fnewatlas.com%2Furban-transport%2Ftoyota-e-palette-tokyo-2020-olympics%2F/1/0100016db5269f12-f1c03c5c-c8f8-4a1b-ab86-7c2b28437b99-000000/JqBHDr5XauHod03e2W-L8JE0pT2LW4NfKpUbpiA0dIM=110" target="_blank">Toyota's autonomous pod to transport athletes around Tokyo 2020 Olympics (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Tokyo's 2020 Olympic Games is set to be a showcase of both technology and human sporting achievement. The medals will be made using scrap metal recovered from electronic waste, and a full line-up of robots will be assisting the public and staff. Toyota will supply 20 special edition e-Palette people movers for the Games. The vehicles will transport athletes throughout the Olympic and Paralympic villages.  The special edition e-Palettes will have sport benches and lift-up seating, and will be able to transport up to four wheelchair users and seven standing passengers at a time. They will feature large sliding doors, low floors, and electric ramps. The design includes contrasting colors to help those with color blindness. A safety operator will be on board, but the vehicles will be using an autonomous driving system that can travel up to 12 mph with Level 4 autonomy. They will have a range of just over 90 miles per charge.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fqz.com%2F1723739%2Ftechnology-oriented-religions-are-coming%2F/1/0100016db5269f12-f1c03c5c-c8f8-4a1b-ab86-7c2b28437b99-000000/dD4fjveo3JbYGdGXjevzjEOOJsFCHbk4gNkIyWdUKpA=110" target="_blank">Technology-oriented religions are coming (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Modern religions have generally been unsuccessful in scaling beyond the cults of personality or the niches of Scientology. However, as technology evolves, it can become a platform for new types of technology-based religions. People have already started incorporating technology into their spiritual views. The internet is helping ideas spread quickly to wide audiences. New technologies can help people achieve self-improvement, for example, there are now apps and wearables that aim to help users achieve mindfulness. Modern surveillance methods can help support a new type of peer-pressured submission. 84 percent of the global population identifies as religious. Many new social movements rely heavily on technology, and it is just a matter of time before new religious movements appear.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fprabhupant%2Fpython-ds/1/0100016db5269f12-f1c03c5c-c8f8-4a1b-ab86-7c2b28437b99-000000/eQ_V9FCAwNoj6xEuEAOemnNCTSYlZx2QajoiSFMKfzw=110" target="_blank">python-ds (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">This repository contains questions and resources regarding data structures and algorithms in Python.

More cameras and microphones are entering into consumers' lives as tech companies research, develop, and market new products. New technology does not have to come at the cost of privacy, despite what tech companies say. Stopping companies and governments from mining data from people will not be easy. Attempts are already being made to regulate facial recognition technology while the technology is still in its infancy. Some companies, such as Google, have made the process of deleting customer data easier, giving consumers a bit more control over their lives.</p> <br><br>
