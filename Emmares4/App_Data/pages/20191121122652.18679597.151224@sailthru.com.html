<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">On Sept. 30 of this year, the stock of discount brokerage firm TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. closed at $46.70 per share, for a market capitalization of about $25.3 billion. The next day it closed at $34.67, down more than 25%. The reason that Ameritrade lost $6.5 billion of market value in one day is that rival discount brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. announced that, instead of charging commissions for stock trades, it would just not do that. The stock trades would be free.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">We <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMDIvdGhlLXRyYWRlcy13aWxsLWJlLWZyZWUtbm93/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bf61b9163" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="PYR8PN6JIJUQ" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">talked about this decision the next day</a>, and I pointed out that this was not a particularly big loss for Schwab. Last year commissions represented less than 7% of Schwab’s net revenue. Most of Schwab’s money comes from net interest revenue—paying brokerage customers lower rates on their idle cash than it gets by investing that cash—with asset management fees also a big contributor. If you cut commissions to zero, you can (try to) attract more client assets, which means more net interest revenue and more opportunities to sell asset management. It could be a good business decision. On the other hand losing 7% of your revenue is losing 7% of your revenue. All else equal, you’d rather have the extra revenue. And Schwab had to know—everyone knew—that its competitors would cut their commissions to zero to try to keep market share; this is an intensely competitive business, and the main thing that discount brokerages compete on is commissions. Schwab’s stock closed down almost 10% that day, suggesting that loss of commission revenue might outweigh the market-share gains.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">But 10% is less than 25%. Schwab’s decision was way more painful for Ameritrade than it was for Schwab itself, and again the reason is pretty clear. Ameritrade makes more of its living from commissions—<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMjEvc2Nod2FiLXRvLWJ1eS10ZC1hbWVyaXRyYWRlLWluLXJlc2hhcGluZy1vZi1vbmxpbmUtYnJva2VyYWdlcw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Ba2895ba9" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="Q1BQ766S9728" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">36% of net revenue in 2018</a>, versus 7% for Schwab—and, since Schwab’s move basically forced it to <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW52ZXN0bWVudG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAxOTEwMDEvRlJFRS8xOTEwMDk5ODgvdGQtYW1lcml0cmFkZS1maXJlcy1iYWNrLWF0LXNjaHdhYi1ieS1jdXR0aW5nLWNvbW1pc3Npb25zLXRvLXplcm8/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B19770fb0" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">end commissions too</a>, it was losing a lot more money.

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">TD Ameritrade jumped about 17% at 9:39 a.m. in New York trading, the most since 2008. Shares of Schwab were up 8.1%.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">A transaction could be announced as early as Thursday, the person said, asking not to be identified because discussions are private.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Schwab’s purchase would create a $5 trillion titan that would be better positioned to weather the challenges facing today’s brokerages, which include price conscious customers and a low interest rate environment.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Fox Business, which first reported the deal, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21hcmtldHMvY2hhcmxlcy1zY2h3YWItYnV5aW5nLXRkLWFtZXJpdHJhZGUtZm9yLTI2Yg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B7c075e6f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">reports that</a> “Charles Schwab is buying Ameritrade for $26 billion,” which is pretty much what Ameritrade was worth the day before Schwab’s move. Presumably if they’d done a deal on Sept. 30, Schwab would have paid a premium over that price. Instead Schwab tanked Ameritrade’s stock price and then got to buy it for cheap. (Also, loosely speaking, if you are a discount brokerage who has figured out how to make money from customers without charging them commissions, and you buy a discount brokerage who hasn’t mastered that, there are opportunities for synergies.) It has a certain flair. “Schwab Seizes on Industry Turmoil With Plan to Buy TD Ameritrade,” is <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMjEvc2Nod2FiLXRvLWJ1eS10ZC1hbWVyaXRyYWRlLWluLXJlc2hhcGluZy1vZi1vbmxpbmUtYnJva2VyYWdlcw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Da2895ba9" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="Q1BT59T1UM0W" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">the Bloomberg headline</a>, but of course Schwab <em>created </em>that turmoil, <em>then </em>seized on it.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If I were on Ameritrade’s board of directors I would, of course, fulfill my fiduciary duties to shareholders by carefully evaluating the financial and other merits of any merger proposal, but I’d also be kind of annoyed to get one from Schwab. You guys put us in this situation; now you want to take advantage of it? I look forward to reading the “Background of the Merger” section of the Schwab/Ameritrade proxy statement to see how this unfolded. Were Schwab and Ameritrade in discussions before Schwab’s price cut? Did Schwab cut its commissions without warning Ameritrade, and then show up at that day’s merger negotiations with a sly grin? Or—as I suspect is true—did the discussions only really start after the price cut? Did Schwab call up Ameritrade the day after cutting commissions and say, with total mock-innocence, “hey, I see you guys are having a rough day, can we help?” </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One sort of funny thing about the discount brokerage business is that, more than in some other industries, the different discount brokers have different owners. It is right in the names: Charles R. Schwab, the human person, owns about 9.7% of Charles Schwab Corp.; Toronto-Dominion Bank (that is, TD) owns about 43.2% of TD Ameritrade, and founder Joe Ricketts owns another 8.6%.

Common ownership might also <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMTIvaWYteW91LW93bi1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXdoeS1tZXJnZQ/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B59670e24" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="Q0V8OW6KLVR4" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">reduce the incentives for companies to merge</a>: If you all have the same shareholders anyway, it matters less whether you are one company or two. In discount brokerage, on the other hand, each company has different concentrated shareholders, and they just had a vicious price war that seems likely to end in consolidation. The system works I guess.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Mutual fund companies run active mutual funds, in which people or computers pick which stocks to buy, and passive index funds, which just buy all the stocks in a given index. Running a passive fund is cheap, since you don’t need a person or a computer to pick the stocks, but the downside is you can’t charge very much for it. If you run an active fund you can charge a lot more, but some of the money has to go to paying people to pick the stocks.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">There is also a third sort of thing called an “enhanced index fund,” which is in the middle; typically it buys the stocks in the index, but it tries to outperform the index by weighting them differently. You have to pay someone to pick the weights, though maybe you can pay them less than the people whom you’d pay to pick stocks from scratch; you can charge more than you would for a passive fund, though maybe less than you would for an active fund. Also, helpfully, you get to use the word “index” in the name—people like indexing—while still charging more than for a regular index fund. </p>

The redundancies led to a review of the investment strategy for the Global Enhanced Equity Funds as HGIL no longer had sufficient resources to apply the alpha overlay to all six Global Enhanced Equity Funds. Consequently, HGIL decided in November 2011 that the alpha overlay would be removed from four of the six Global Enhanced Equity Funds, including the Japan and North American Funds, over a period of time.</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">However, HGIL continued to apply what it referred as “beta enhancements” to the four affected funds. These beta enhancements aimed to produce small incremental enhancements through efficiency and cost reduction practices, such as stock lending, which involved earning a fee for actively lending stock to third parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Ehh, that doesn’t sound very enhanced to me? Lots of regular old index funds do stock lending to keep costs down and boost returns slightly. Neither Henderson nor the FCA really thinks this counts as enhancement, but it is not like that's a particularly technical term, so I suppose you could argue that they were still a little enhanced.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">You might think that if you have an enhanced index fund, and you lay off the people who were enhancing it, then you have to stop calling it an enhanced index fund. This is a problem, though, because you can charge a lot more for an enhanced index fund than for a regular index fund. So Henderson said, well, who is to say how enhanced an enhanced fund really has to be?</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">HGIL decided that, as the Prospectus was silent on the extent of any enhancement, it did not require amending provided that HGIL could demonstrate that the affected funds had a residual level of enhancement. HGIL reasoned that a fund that delivers enhanced returns over time does not need to maintain the same level of enhancement over that time and that the beta enhancements were sufficient to continue to call the affected funds “enhanced”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Actually a lot of investors in the funds <em>had </em>been promised a specific amount of enhancement: Henderson “identified that the change would affect some of its institutional investors who had been promised specific outperformance targets, as the change would mean that those targets could no longer be met.” So it contacted those institutional investors—who made up 95% of the funds’ assets under management—and told them that (1) the funds were now passive and (2) the funds were now free. (“We propose to manage the passive portion of the portfolio for free – not at passive fees, for free.”) Nice! </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The other 5%, ehh:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Some within HGIL questioned whether, if the funds became passive, HGIL could continue to justify the retail investors incurring the same level of management fees (150bps or 75bps depending on which share class they were invested in): “I can’t see how we could continue to charge this if we are telling everyone this is a tracker product”. However, as the Prospectus was silent on the extent of any enhancement and in the absence of any commitments having been made to retail investors relating to levels of enhancement, as at April 2012 HGIL decided that its change in investment strategy would not need to be communicated to retail investors. … Further, HGIL did not reduce the level of fees paid by retail investors from their existing management fees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Ha, well. There is a brutal logic to this, isn’t there? You told investors that their funds were enhanced, but you didn’t say how they were enhanced, or how enhanced they were. Techhhhhhhhhhnically if you just track the index but send account statements on high-quality paper stock then you can say “well we’re an enhanced index fund aren’t we.” And you did tell them about the fees. The fees were disclosed. And while 150 or 75 basis points is a pretty high fee for an index fund, it’s not like there’s a law setting index-fund fees. In some crude sense the investors are paying 150bps for the word “enhanced,” and if they don’t like the level of enhancement they’re getting then they can take their money out and invest it elsewhere.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Obviously that is all dumb, the retail investors aren’t paying attention, the word “enhanced” <em>ought </em>to mean <em>something</em>, and the FCA is right to fine Henderson. (To be fair Henderson wasn’t <em>wholly </em>cynical about this; they seem to have felt bad all along, and kept talking about “re-enhancing” the funds without ever getting around to it.) “The retail investors would likely have considered that the level of enhancements applied to the Japan and North American Funds were insufficient for the fees being charged,” says the FCA. Obviously that is a hypothetical because the retail investors <em>didn’t </em>consider that; they didn’t consider anything; this whole thing only worked because the retail investors weren’t paying attention.

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">For another thing, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMjAveW91LWRvbi10LW5lZWQtdG8tcGljay10aGUtc3RvY2tz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bbb0cadc0" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="Q1A2BU6S9729" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">it seems to me</a> that the banks just took on a high-risk, high-reward bet: They told Aramco that it should be able to do an international IPO at a $2 trillion valuation, which always seemed unlikely, but they gambled that they'd either be able to pull it off or at least be able to talk Aramco into a lower valuation. If that had worked they’d be getting big fees and league table credit and the promise of lots of lucrative future work. It didn’t work and now they’re sad. But that is life; your big gambles can’t all work out. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Anyway now <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvOTk2YzU2YzYtMGJhOS0xMWVhLWJiNTItMzRjOGQ5ZGM2ZDg0/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B0691e955" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">the Financial Times has a story</a> about how most of the “global coordinators” on the IPO will no longer be globally coordinating: “only three of the nine ‘global co-ordinators’ picked to lead the deal — HSBC and Saudi Arabia’s NCB Capital and Samba Capital — will actually have oversight of all investor orders”; the other “global co-ordinators including Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will now submit their orders to HSBC.” This honestly doesn’t matter even a tiny little bit, but capital markets banking is all about fighting over tiny pointless distinctions so here is a glorious quote:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">One banker, speaking about the effective demotion of all the major international banks bar HSBC, said: “Global co-ordinator means you co-ordinate on a global basis. Here a global co-ordinator is neither.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Counterpoint: “Global co-ordinator” means absolutely nothing, and the fact that these six banks don’t have much control over the book that they’re not building for the IPO that they’re not doing is really the least of their problems. Still it is funny that they’re mad about this stuff. Also of course money though:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Many advisers were expecting to be rewarded handsomely for their work after years of preparations. It is believed that the downgrade in their roles since Riyadh shrunk its ambitions for the IPO will also imply a dramatic cut to the fees pool.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Banks had been expected to earn fees of 35 basis points of the proceeds, or around $90m at the high end of the range, said one person briefed on the remuneration structure and earlier reported by Reuters. The banks would have earned more if the deal had led to a higher valuation and resulted in a bigger piece of the company sold.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Yes, right, if they’d delivered the deal that Aramco wanted they’d have gotten paid for it. But they didn’t.</p>

Then they find real people to sign those letters, sometimes without reading them, and they send them off to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and eventually Bloomberg reporters <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMTkvc2VjLWNoYWlybWFuLWNpdGVzLWZpc2h5LWxldHRlcnMtaW4tc3VwcG9ydC1vZi1wb2xpY3ktY2hhbmdl/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B3165d8d0" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="Q181FUT0G1KZ" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">discover that they’re fake</a> and it’s embarrassing for all concerned. People tend to think that it’s bad to submit fictitious comment letters to the SEC.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I was more forgiving, though. I like reading fiction! Reading fiction helps develop empathy, helps you understand the minds of other people. It can convey a truth that is deeper than any mere facts. “Novelists tell that piece of truth hidden at the bottom of every lie,” <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18679597.151224/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9wL0IzcFNzNlFGbFJ4Lw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B4d224640" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">says Calvino</a>. The fact that, for instance, ordinary investors don’t actually care about your proposed rule change isn’t <em>that </em>important; if you can imagine what an ordinary investor <em>might </em>say, and write it down, and invest it with life and conviction and verisimilitude, to the point that readers (at the SEC) are convinced that your rule change will benefit ordinary investors, then your letter is true in a certain sense, even though it is fake in a more literal sense. Oh sure <em>lying </em>is bad, but that’s easy to fix. “The obvious solution here is to explicitly allow fictional comment letters,” I wrote, half-jokingly, and I half-jokingly stand by it.</p>

Cross-functional teams should be small enough that two pizzas would suffice for dinner. Many meetings start with 30 minutes of silence as everyone reads the same six-page document. Employees pitching new products create fictional press releases to focus on the benefits to customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">“Write more fiction” is one of those practices that is being exported:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Cate Khan, co-founder of shopping website Verishop and a 7-year veteran of Amazon, said the first thing she did when she was thinking about the company’s positioning was write a fictional press release—what Amazon refers to as a “PRFAQ.” </p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Great! Obviously you don’t <em>put out </em>the press release for a product that doesn’t exist, but the process of <em>writing </em>the fake press release is informative. You can learn something about what you want the product to be by selling it before you make it.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">“Write less PowerPoint” is another good Amazon principle, by the way:</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">In the early 2000s, Mr. Bezos inspired one of the more famous Amazon organizational tools: The narrative, or “six-pager” in Amazon parlance, a document that a team of employees writes when proposing an idea.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">PowerPoint presentations are now banned at Amazon, and it’s common for meetings to begin with a long stretch of quiet as everyone reads six-pagers—a tactic Mr. Bezos adopted to ensure that executives actually process the proposal before discussing their merits and asking questions. </p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">“One of the things I flagrantly ripped off from Amazon was the narrative,” said Adam Selipsky, the CEO of software maker Tableau.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Narrative! Great stuff. It is a nice piece of dramatic irony that Amazon, which is killing bookstores, is at the same time reviving the market for fiction and narrative nonfiction in corporate America.</p>
