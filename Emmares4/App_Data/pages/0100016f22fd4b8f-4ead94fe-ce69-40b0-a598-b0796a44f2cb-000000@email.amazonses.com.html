It will cover 219,000 square feet across two separate buildings.

The game studio is about to release its first game in January 2020. Typhoon Studios has built a team of industry veterans who have experience in building many triple-A games. Stadia was announced in March this year and launched with 22 games in mid-November. More games are being continually added, and Google will launch a broader service with more content in the coming months.

This resulted in a domino effect, causing mass liquidations in the market, which led to bitcoin's price dropping to below $7,000 within 30 minutes. Some of the scammers have been selling their coins since June when bitcoin reached its year-to-date high of around $14,000. Around the same time, Chinese authorities detained some of the people suspected of being involved with the PlusToken scam. The scammers still have a large amount of bitcoin yet unliquidated, so there is a chance that they may continue selling and push the market down further.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Finterestingengineering.com%2Frobert-downey-jrs-series-on-ai-is-available-on-youtube-right-now/1/0100016f22fd4b8f-4ead94fe-ce69-40b0-a598-b0796a44f2cb-000000/iczoeBW6WsKuvIBF_n5k-BYydBkbuP5EvfmY6es9FFk=120" target="_blank">Robert Downey Jr.'s Series on AI Is Available on YouTube Right Now (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">YouTube has released its new documentary series, The Age of AI.

The raw data is available for download. Most respondents were from the US, Canada, and the UK, with a median salary of between $50k-$100k. 91.3 percent of the respondents were male. Jest, TypeScript, Express, React, Mocha, and Redux were highly recommended technologies to adopt. JavaScript is constantly adding new features, and there are many that haven't been adopted into mainstream use. Typescript is still the most popular JavaScript flavor. React is the leading front-end framework again, after dropping behind Vue.js last year. All other top technologies from 2018 retained their positions in 2019. The most popular resources were CSS Tricks, Medium, Stack Overflow, Udemy, Syntax, and React Podcast. Overall, most developers are happy with the way JavaScript has been developed and its future.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Finteractive%2F2019%2F12%2F19%2Fopinion%2Flocation-tracking-cell-phone.html/1/0100016f22fd4b8f-4ead94fe-ce69-40b0-a598-b0796a44f2cb-000000/IEt11JS0oToOifEpT_4uFf4zbDPyCVkVrhojw9oqKPA=120" target="_blank">Twelve Million Phones, One Dataset, Zero Privacy (20 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Every moment, companies are tracking the movements of millions of mobile phones and storing them in gigantic data files. One of these files holds more than 50 billion location pings from more than 12 million Americans over several months between 2016 and 2017. People who have access to this data can see every place that an individual has been. The dataset discussed in the article is just a small sample of what is collected. This kind of precise, always-on human tracking gives governments and corporations huge amounts of power, and it is perfectly legal to collect and sell all this information. The data is only policed through internal company policies and the decency of individual employees. People are placing blind faith in companies who claim that the data they collect is secure and only shared with vetted partners. Even if companies are acting with the highest moral standards, data can be stolen.</p> <br><br>
