Michael and Kelly Collver were the first customers to receive a package from the service. They ordered a cough and cold pack to be delivered to their home in Christianburg, Virginia. Wing obtained its Air Carrier Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration earlier this year, which allowed Wing pilots to manage multiple aircraft flying without any human pilot on board. Earlier this month, UPS also secured FAA approval to operate a commercial drone delivery service.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness-50080806/1/0100016dedcc53da-662a3e39-106b-4c62-8b6b-653357ad7168-000000/31gR4ZD8oiYd6GVvesi13UX8yTM2EgpO9zIt5RzREKw=111" target="_blank">Tesla gets the go-ahead to build cars in China (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Tesla is building a $2 billion factory in Shanghai which will manufacture at least 1,000 Model 3s each week.

The Gigafactory 3 will be the first fully-foreign owned car plant in China. Shanghai authorities have offered help to speed up construction of the plant. China has excluded Tesla vehicles from its 10% tax on cars. The plant may be a sign that China is looking to open up its car market.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Ftechnology%2Frobots%2Fa29514131%2Fhumanoid-robot-face/1/0100016dedcc53da-662a3e39-106b-4c62-8b6b-653357ad7168-000000/uEwkemfhCjd-DuaQip3OjPlsaqihEaT2gJgkn7W81rM=111" target="_blank">Want $125k?

Current rules are costly and some procedures do not make sense, considering the scientific knowledge we have gained since the rules were created. The Moon is classified as potentially of interest for research on the origins of life, but few scientists now see it as an important site for studying these questions, except for at its poles. Reclassifying the Moon as nonessential for biological studies would simplify exploration for space agencies. Mars has been treated as if microbes could survive on the planet, but many scientists now think that it is unlikely. Earth has been bombarded by meteorites that originated from Mars with no known biological harm in the past, so its guidelines for returning samples should be reviewed. NASA is not a regulatory agency, and commercial actors, for example, Tesla, have launched objects into space with no planetary protection evaluation in the past. Humans will eventually contaminate Mars, so research into water-rich regions should be explored as soon as possible.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbregman-arie%2Fdevops-interview-questions/1/0100016dedcc53da-662a3e39-106b-4c62-8b6b-653357ad7168-000000/Uh0LIDfsw4LYiE2V6tgASbajeI6LplTTtp9geD8XYPg=111" target="_blank">DevOps Interview Questions (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">This repository contains 300 questions on various DevOps related topics.

(Hacker News Thread)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">While the Macbook Pro has amazing specs, Apple has demonstrated its inability to be reliable. The original poster has had to repair their MBP three times since they purchased it in January 2019 and they are worried about being charged for repairs after the warranty runs out. Top recommendations are for the Dell XPS series. Most of the discussion centers around an analogy between macOS and Linux, comparing it to living in a hotel vs living at home. On the Mac ecosystem, everything is stylish and cared for, but there is little freedom to change things. However, on Linux, you need to do many things yourself, but it is completely yours.</p> <br><br>
