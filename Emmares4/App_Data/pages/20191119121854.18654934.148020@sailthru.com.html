<h3 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 21px; line-height: 28px; font-weight: bold; Margin-bottom: 18px; Margin-top: 18px">Don’t read the comments</h3>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Most debates over financial regulation are, in an obvious first-order sense, about whether regulation should favor one group of rich powerful financial professionals, or another group. Corporate governance disputes, for instance, basically come down to whether corporate chief executive officers should have more control of their companies, or whether instead more control should go to hedge fund managers and the executives of big asset management companies. This is a problem because regulators can’t really make rules on this basis. They can’t be like “we’ve heard that some CEOs’ feelings are hurt when hedge fund managers criticize their multimillion-dollar paychecks, so we’re changing the rules to be nicer to the CEOs.”</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">They don’t have to, though, because this is only true in an obvious first-order sense. In fact the CEOs and the hedge fund managers are just representatives of broader groups and more important principles. The hedge fund managers will tell you that they invest the pension money of ordinary people, and that anyway they are advocating for more power for ordinary investors. The CEOs will tell you that they just want to be able to make long-term decisions for the good of their companies in a way that will preserve ordinary people’s jobs and savings. And then if the regulators make a rule favoring the CEOs they can talk about the ordinary workers they’re protecting, and if they make a rule favoring the hedge fund managers they can talk about the ordinary investors they’re protecting, and it is all much more palatable than if you just talk about the CEOs and the hedge fund managers, and also it is basically true. It’s not like the CEOs and the hedge fund managers are fighting each other in a closed ecosystem; the balance of power between them does matter, in an indirect but real way, for everyone else.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">It can all feel pretty abstract, though. It’s all well and good to <em>say </em>that you’re representing ordinary people, but it’s better to <em>show </em>it. Ideally what you want is for some ordinary people to write letters to the regulators saying “actually you should favor corporate CEOs over hedge fund managers because of my retirement savings,” or whatever. It can be hard to find ordinary people who actually think that, though, or who have paid enough attention to the issue to write those letters; it feels pretty abstract to them too!</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">So the next-best choice is to <em>imagine </em>what ordinary people <em>would </em>say if they <em>actually </em>supported your side, and then write that down. Write an imaginary letter on behalf of an imaginary ordinary person, urging the regulator to take the side that favors CEOs or hedge fund managers, whichever side you’re on.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">And then once you’ve written that letter just find a real ordinary person and ask her to sign it, whatever, who cares, it’s just a letter, who is going to check.</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">When Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton handed a policy win to corporate executives this month, he pointed to a surprising source of support: a mailbag full of encouragement from ordinary Americans.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">To hear Clayton tell it, these folks are really focused on the intricacies of the corporate shareholder-voting process. “Some of the letters that struck me the most,” he said at a commission meeting in Washington, “came from long-term Main Street investors, including an Army veteran and a Marine veteran, a police officer, a retired teacher, a public servant, a single mom, a couple of retirees who saved for retirement.” Each bolstered Clayton’s case for limiting the power of dissenting shareholders.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">But a close look at the seven letters Clayton highlighted, and about two dozen others submitted to the SEC by supposedly regular people, shows they are the product of a misleading -- and laughably clumsy -- public relations campaign by corporate interests.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">That retired teacher? Pauline Yee said she never wrote a letter, although the signature was hers. … “I never wrote a letter,” said one of the retirees, Vytautas Alksninis, reached by phone at his home in Connecticut. “What’s this all about?”</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Then there’s the public servant Clayton mentioned. … She said the letter originated with a public-affairs firm that contacted her out of the blue.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">“They wrote it, and I allowed them to use my name after I read it,” she said. “I didn’t go digging into all of this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">What is particularly bad here is that “at least 20” of the fake letters contain “an out-of-context phrase inserted into the SEC’s mailing address”: If you’re writing a letter to the SEC, you put the SEC’s address at the top just for old time’s sake (of course you don’t mail it, you just submit it online), and for some reason the person mass-writing these letters inserted the phrase “A Coalition of Growth Companies” into the address that he or she cut and pasted into all the fake letters. Oops!</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The specific debate here is about the regulation of proxy advisers; we have talked about it a <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18654934.148020/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMjkvY29tcGFuaWVzLXB1c2gtYmFjay1vbi1wcm94eS1hZHZpc2Vycw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B97bbfe6d" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="Q058Q46KLVR7" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">couple</a> of <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18654934.148020/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTEtMDYvYWR2aWNlLWlzLWRpZmZlcmVudC1mcm9tLXNvbGljaXRhdGlvbg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bab7917b8" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="Q0K5606KLVRB" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">times</a> before. Basically there are companies called proxy advisers that tell investment managers how to vote on corporate matters, and sometimes they tell the investment managers to vote against corporate management, and the managers don’t like that so they’ve asked the SEC to regulate the advisers more. They can’t just come out and say that, so instead the argument is that the proxy advisers, and the big investment funds who rely on them, might have political and social and governance and power agendas that conflict with the interests of the individual humans whose retirement savings are invested in those funds—that people’s savings are “being steered by third parties to promote individual agendas, rather than to further their primary goals of being able to have enough money,” as <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18654934.148020/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9uZXdzL3B1YmxpYy1zdGF0ZW1lbnQvc3RhdGVtZW50LWNsYXl0b24tMjAxOS0xMS0wNS1vcGVuLW1lZXRpbmc/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B83f06622" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta itemprop="type" content="WebLink">Clayton said</a> in the next sentence of his statement.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Obviously you <em>can’t </em>find people to say that, because no normal human actually pays attention to or cares about any of this. But if you work on one side of the issue, you can convince yourself that normal people <em>should </em>care about it, and then you can imagine what they might say if they did care, and then you can write it down, and then as a final, only-somewhat-fraudulent step, you can go find an ordinary person to sign the letter you wrote. Perhaps you can even give them a brief summary of the issue, and let them read the letter they’re signing, and get them to care about it enough to agree with you for five minutes before they forget all about it.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The thing is the letters are fine! Whoever wrote them mostly did a good job of imagining how an SEC chairman, or a financial columnist for that matter, would imagine how an 83-year-old Army veteran would think about proxy advisers if he bothered to think about proxy advisers. As works of fiction they have a certain verisimilitude.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Of course it is gross to find out that they are fictional, and that the SEC is citing the support of “Main Street investors” who do not actually support the regulation, but you should not kid yourself that it matters. The SEC isn’t changing the rules because it believes that that’s what Main Street investors want; it’s changing the rules because it believes that that’s what Main Street investors <em>would want, </em>if they paid attention to any of this. The SEC, and the people actually writing the letters, agree that this change is in the interests of ordinary investors and is the sort of thing that ordinary investors would want. It just feels more concrete if they can point to a ordinary investor who does want it.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The obvious solution here is to explicitly allow fictional comment letters. Of course the SEC already allows fictional comment letters, in the sense that it doesn’t seem to do any identity checking, and we have <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18654934.148020/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTctMTItMTMvcmVndWxhdG9yeS1jb21tZW50cy1hbmQtY2VvLXNraWxs/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bf4c4de26" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="P0WN0V6JTSEE" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">talked before</a> about how lots of comment letters are blatantly fictitious. Many fictitious comment letters seem to be submitted for the sake of numbers: It is nice to say “a hundred ordinary investors wrote in to support this,” or whatever, but that’s rarely true and should not be taken seriously. But other fictitious letters are like these letters; they are submitted for the sake of their argument, and for a certain ordinary-investor flavor that comes from a talented writer of fiction trying to channel what he thinks an ordinary investor would actually feel and say. Why not let those fiction writers practice openly? Why not submit a letter from like the Coalition of Giant Company CEOs saying “as CEOs, we like this rule, but we also think it’s in the interests of ordinary investors, and to give you a sense of that here’s what we imagine an 83-year-old Army veteran might hypothetically have to say about it.” And then you write the fake letter, and the SEC can say “we too can easily imagine that an elderly veteran might say ‘how disgusted I am that my financial investments are being used as a political pawn,’” etc. etc. etc., it loses almost none of its rhetorical effect for being fake. Just admit that it’s all fake!</p>

We can argue about whose fault that is—no, obviously it’s Aramco’s fault, or rather the fault of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who insisted on an unrealistic $2 trillion valuation for the company—but the fact is, Aramco (and its owner, the Saudi government) wanted a certain IPO, and hired banks to deliver it, and the banks did not. And Saudi Arabia and Aramco don’t desperately <em>need </em>the IPO; even in the most optimistic case, the IPO would have raised $100 billion, or <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18654934.148020/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDQtMDEvc2F1ZGktYXJhbWNvLW1ha2VzLWEtbG90LW9mLW1vbmV5/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bfbeca94d" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="PPBZ2N6KLVRG" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">a bit less than a year’s worth</a> of Aramco’s net income, and the numbers that the bankers were actually aiming for were even more trifling compared to Aramco’s ability to generate cash from operations.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">And so Aramco will more or less walk away from the international portion of its IPO, and just do a small (and higher-priced) local listing in which it sells shares mostly to local investors, and the international bankers feel, and are, kind of awkward and superfluous.</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">It was then that Saudi Aramco announced its 1.5 per cent sale at a price that would value its shares at $1.6tn-$1.7tn and raise only as much as $25.6bn.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Plans to market the shares directly in the US, Europe and Asia were also scrapped. The IPO would be focused on Saudi and Gulf investors. … Given the constrained distribution, some advisers working for the dozens of banks on the deal now question their purpose. Collective banking fees from the IPO, which have yet to be disclosed, are also likely to be much lower than anticipated.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I feel like, if you are one of these banks, you have to be a little philosophical about this. The client wanted a thing you couldn’t give him, so you didn’t. So your fees will be low. What do you want? Sure you jumped through hoops, but the only real hoop was “bring us a $2 trillion IPO,” and you never got within miles of that.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Of course it is easy to blame the client: The thing he wanted was unrealistic, and you explained that to him, and he didn’t listen to you. But to be fair that’s kind of your fault too!</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Well, right? I mean, that’s the way the game is played; if they want a $2 trillion valuation, you tell them they’ll get a $2 trillion valuation to win the mandate, and then you walk them back from there. But it was not exactly a secret that they really wanted the $2 trillion! If you can’t give it to them, they’ll be disappointed, and you have to be ready to be disappointed too. Aramco wanted a $2 trillion IPO, and the banks knew that, and they pitched a $2 trillion IPO, and that pitch was a big gamble. If it worked out—if either the market moved such that they could get a $2 trillion IPO, or if they were able to use their powers of persuasion to get Salman and Rumayyan happy with a lower valuation—then the banks would get the prestige and fees of leading a giant IPO. It did not work out.</p>

If the company has to pay to replace your stuff, why not say you had a bit more stuff than you really did? One, it’s hard to check (all the stuff is burned up); two, the company is probably not paying that much attention (it has a lot of claims to process); and three, even if the company does dispute your claims, you are a sympathetic innocent victim of its actions while it is a much-loathed arsonist.

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Second, I made fun of bond investors for getting mad that bonds price high in the face of high demand. Banks will launch bond deals with initial price talk that is relatively cheap (high yields), build lots of investor demand, and then tighten the pricing considerably. Investors who hoped to get cheap bonds are stuck with expensive ones, and they complain, and I wasn’t having it. “If you are interested at a high yield but not at a lower one,” I wrote, “you can pull your order when the yield goes down during marketing. If you’re still interested at the lower yield that clears the market, but you would rather be getting an above-market yield, just … like … why?”</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">But an investor pushed back on this, pointing out that actually investors face some pressure <em>not </em>to pull their orders as pricing tightens. It’s not like an equity offering, where people put in orders at price limits; the informal expectation in these bond deals is that if you’re in, you’re in at whatever the market-clearing price ends up being. If you consistently put in orders at the initial price talk, and pull them at the final price, underwriters will start thinking of you as a flake, and you will find yourself getting shut out of allocations in future, more attractive deals. As long as initial price talk is a good guide for final pricing, this is not a big problem, but when deals regularly price much tighter than their initial talk, investors have some reason to feel hard done by.</p>

<em>[1] Though … reading the indictment, I get the sense that there was no actual foreign bribery or embezzlement? The indictment says things like “which funds BAGLEY and others believed to be derived from graft and corruption” and “BAGLEY … discussed the fact that they were moving funds on behalf of Individual-2 and that the funds represented the proceeds of foreign bribery and embezzlement stolen from the Venezuelan people,” but it doesn’t say that they *were*. If there was real embezzlement—if real people were harmed—presumably the Justice Department would have said that. Perhaps that’s just hard to prove at this point. But another possibility is that the whole thing is a fake crime created by the FBI, a sting operation designed to nab someone—Bagley—who seemed like he might be a money launderer. (Where did the FBI get that idea? From searching Amazon?) </em>
