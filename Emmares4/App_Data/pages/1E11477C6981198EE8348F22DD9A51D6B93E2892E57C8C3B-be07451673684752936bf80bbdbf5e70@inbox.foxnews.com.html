			<strong>May 21, 2020</strong><br>
			<strong>By Chris Stirewalt</strong></h2>

			<br>
			<span style="font-size:20px;"><strong><em>On the roster: </em></strong><strong><em>It’s all about the economy, so it’s all about corona</em></strong> <strong><em>- I’ll Tell You What: A new, New Deal - Corona-era layoffs approach 40 million - Sanders tells delegates to get in line - Does anybody have 176,552 teaspoons of butter?</em></strong><br>
			 <br>
			<strong>IT’S ALL ABOUT THE ECONOMY, SO IT’S ALL ABOUT CORONA</strong><br>
			It’s too simple to say that elections are always about the economy. If that were so, <strong>President Trump</strong> would have been doing better when things were going great guns before the coronavirus.<br>
			<br>
			But it would not be too much to say that whenever the economy is out of whack, no other issue matters nearly as much.<br>
			<br>
			When it comes to the most important issue for 2020, the question of coronavirus and the economy will be inseparable. As Trump himself has pointed out, restoring economic vitality to our battered nation will depend on defeating, or at least containing, the virus.<br>
			<br>
			This has been Trump’s biggest political conundrum of the current crisis. As we <a target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" href="http://inbox.foxnews.com/t?r=6055&c=4921&l=36&ctl=19210:1E11477C6981198EE8348F22DD9A51D6B93E2892E57C8C3B&">discussed two months ago</a>, those voters most skeptical of the need to take aggressive steps to deal with the virus are those in Trump’s own base. We see it playing out with increasing intensity as the national reopening continues in fits and spurts.<br>
			<br>
			Trump shares the suspicions of many of his supporters about the necessity of wearing masks in public places, but those masks are vehicles for reopening. Not only do health officials say they help slow the spread of the virus, but they help anxious consumers and workers feel safer.<br>
			<br>
			Similarly, avoiding large gatherings -- especially those that draw participants from far and near -- is another key to preventing new outbreaks and increasing public confidence. But don’t try telling that to many of the Republican faithful who are <a target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" href="http://inbox.foxnews.com/t?r=6055&c=4921&l=36&ctl=19211:1E11477C6981198EE8348F22DD9A51D6B93E2892E57C8C3B&">getting geared up</a> for a full-scale convention in Charlotte.<br>
			<br>
			The last thing Trump needs is to have a big fracas over public health safety in the largest city of a crucial swing state for the kick off to the fall campaign season. Whatever Republicans thought about the relative risks, it’s hard to see the political advantage of such an event.<br>
			<br>
			If they wanted to improve their chances, GOPers would happily embrace a safety-first, scaled down event. But to many on the Red Team, that would seem like giving in.<br>
			<br>
			If you ever wondered how strong partisanship has become, our ability to make public health policy a partisan issue should tell you plenty. Many Republicans treat precautions as knock-kneed liberal hoo-ha. Many Democrats treat even cautious reopening as recklessness based on greed and an antediluvian attitude toward science. When you put those together, rationality goes right out the window.<br>
			<br>
			It would certainly not be good for <strong>Joe Biden</strong> for Democrats to be perceived as a party opposed to reopening and, by extension, the party in favor of prolonged economic malaise. Watching Democratic governors move ahead, in some cases even without having met the recommendations for the Center for Disease Control, tells you about the growing sense of urgency from the Blue Team.<br>
			<br>
			Trump faces the opposite danger, which is that the refusal of some Americans to be careful in the reopening may cause new infections or increase public anxiety about the health concerns. In a best-case scenario for the GOP, Americans would enthusiastically don masks, practice social distancing and get busy getting back to work.<br>
			<br>
			But unlike Biden who enjoys the challenger’s benefit of perfect hindsight, Trump will not be able to effectively blame others if infection rates are not under control and the economy is not rebounding. He can certainly accuse governors of mistakes, but he will not escape the judgment of voters.<br>
			<br>
			Right now, it looks like this election will be all about the economy, which will depend on Americans’ confidence that the health crisis is under control.<br>

And so I don’t ever remember a moment of thinking, Oh, they’re funny. I remember watching them onstage and seeing them perform and get laughs, and do their act. I remember, as a kid, enjoying watching that and thinking, Oh, this is kind of cool that everybody thinks my parents are funny. And it was exciting. … [Comedy] came to [Stiller’s mother <strong>Anne Meara</strong>] very easily, but it was always work… My dad was always working at it and thinking about things.”<br>

			<strong>CORONA-ERA LAYOFFS APPROACH 40 MILLION</strong><br>
			<a target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" href="http://inbox.foxnews.com/t?r=6055&c=4921&l=36&ctl=19217:1E11477C6981198EE8348F22DD9A51D6B93E2892E57C8C3B&">USA Today</a>: “Layoffs fueled by the coronavirus pandemic continue to mount. About 2.4 million Americans filed initial unemployment benefit claims last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, as the health and economic crisis sparked by the coronavirus ruptures a growing number of industries. In just nine weeks, 38.6 million have sought jobless benefits that represent the nation’s most reliable gauge of layoffs. The latest claims tally was down from the 3 million who filed claims the week before, and the record 6.9 million who sought assistance in late March. Initial applications for unemployment insurance have now steadily declined seven weeks in a row. But the tens of millions of Americans who have applied for assistance in just over two months is a staggering number, reflecting a 14.7% jobless rate that is the highest since the Great Depression.”<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Real number of claims substantially higher - </strong><a target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" href="http://inbox.foxnews.com/t?r=6055&c=4921&l=36&ctl=19218:1E11477C6981198EE8348F22DD9A51D6B93E2892E57C8C3B&">WSJ</a>: “The claims totals exclude hundreds of thousands of self-employed and gig-economy workers receiving unemployment benefits for the first time through a temporary coronavirus-related program. The omission of self-employed workers means the actual number of workers seeking claims has been higher since the federal program called pandemic unemployment assistance, included in a stimulus package approved in late March, got under way.”<br>
			<br>
			<strong>The worst may be over, but the recovery looks painfully slow - </strong><a target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" href="http://inbox.foxnews.com/t?r=6055&c=4921&l=36&ctl=19219:1E11477C6981198EE8348F22DD9A51D6B93E2892E57C8C3B&">WSJ</a>: “Business activity in the U.S., Europe and Japan continued to fall in May, though at a slower pace than in prior months, offering early signs that the global economy may have already experienced the worst of the economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak. Still, the data released Thursday suggest that any economic recovery will be painfully slow. Surveys of purchasing managers showed private-sector activity fell for the third straight month in May, despite the tentative reopening of many economies around the world. … The surveys pointed to continued job cuts… That rise in unemployment will likely act as a drag on any recovery as affected households cut back on spending. ‘Demand is likely to remain extremely weak for a prolonged period, putting further pressure on companies to make more aggressive job cuts,’ said <strong>Chris Williamson</strong>, IHS Markit’s chief business economist. ‘We therefore expect…a full recovery to take several years.’”<br>

			<strong>Vulnerable GOP senators push stimulus - </strong><a target="_blank" data-auth="NotApplicable" href="http://inbox.foxnews.com/t?r=6055&c=4921&l=36&ctl=1921A:1E11477C6981198EE8348F22DD9A51D6B93E2892E57C8C3B&">Fox News</a>: “Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> has sought to hit pause on the government’s massive spending for coronavirus-related relief packages, but several of his Republican colleagues are pushing for additional stimulus measures during the economic crisis. McConnell told reporters earlier this month that after already spending close to $3 trillion, Congress should ‘take a pause’ to assess the current situation, which includes a rising national debt, but a contingent of GOP senators has supported moving forward with another relief package. ‘Our bill would help offset the collapse of state and local revenues resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,’ Sen. <strong>Susan Collins</strong>, R-Maine, said on the Senate floor Wednesday, pointing to rising unemployment and hits to sectors of the economy such as agriculture, hospitality, tourism and others. … Sen. <strong>Cory Gardner</strong>, R-Colo., slammed the decision for the Senate to go on recess before taking action on another relief bill.”<br>

			<strong>SANDERS TELLS DELEGATES TO GET IN LINE</strong><br>

The campaign of the senator from Vermont has told some supporters picked to represent him this year to sign agreements barring attacks on other candidates or party leaders, combative confrontations on social media or talking to reporters without approval. The move, which carried a threat of being removed as a delegate, has the effect of blunting one of the most powerful if divisive tools of Sanders’s movement — its unrestrained online presence and tendency to stoke controversy through other media, which has at times spiraled into abuse of his opponents, perceived and real.”<br>

The shift is the latest public signal Warren has sent Biden's way in recent weeks that she wants the job of vice president — and wants Biden to see her as a loyal governing partner despite their past clashes, which go back decades.”<br>

Biden Jr. on Wednesday blasted the Republican response to President Trump’s firings of a string of inspectors general in recent weeks, suggesting that in another era there would have been louder bipartisan criticism for ousting watchdogs. His remarks, part of a virtual round table aimed at a Wisconsin audience… Mr. Biden spoke in forceful terms about his disappointment in some of his former Republican colleagues. ‘That used to be a hobbyhorse for Republican senators,’ said Mr. Biden… ‘Republican senators joined Democrats, they were strongly, strongly, strongly supportive of these independent inspector generals.’ … ‘Where are they?’ he continued. ‘Why aren’t they speaking up about this? It really bothers me. It bothers me a lot.’”<br>

The visit to Ford Motor Co.'s Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti, where the automaker builds ventilators for the national stockpile, comes as the president is sharply criticizing a proposal by Michigan Secretary of State <strong>Jocelyn Benson</strong> to send absentee ballot applications to all registered voters. And state Attorney General <strong>Dana Nessel</strong> is calling on the president to break with his practice and wear a protective mask inside the Ford plant. The plant visit is one stop on a presidential tour touting efforts by American manufacturers to produce medical supplies and personal protective equipment during the pandemic. It comes amid a campaign season upended by candidates' inability to host such traditional events as rallies — and as Trump seeks to shore up support in Michigan, a battleground state considered vitally important to his reelection chances.”<br>

The National Republican Congressional Committee abruptly yanked <strong>Ted Howze</strong>, the party’s nominee against vulnerable freshman Rep. <strong>Josh Harder</strong> (D-Calif.), from its Young Guns program for top recruits. House Minority Leader <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> issued a stern warning to Howze, whom he endorsed personally before the primary election in March. In a statement, McCarthy said he and NRCC Chairman <strong>Tom Emmer</strong> of Minnesota ‘will take immediate action’ if Howze ‘is found to be the originator of these posts.’ Howze’s campaign has told POLITICO that he denies writing them personally, suggesting other, unidentified individuals had access to his accounts.”<br>

			<strong>AUDIBLE: TESTING, PERRY COMO STYLE </strong><br>
			“And I tested very positively in another sense. So this morning. I tested positively toward negative, right? So no, I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning I tested negative. But that’s a way of saying it. Positively toward the negative.” – <em>President Trump talking to reporters before heading to Michigan Thursday.</em><br>
			<br>
			<strong>FROM THE BLEACHERS</strong><br>
			“Why do 99.44% of sane upstanding folks support President Trump and 99.44% of insane nutsy folks support Democrats? Please answer with the legit truth. To quote <strong>Helen Thomas</strong>, one on the democrats side, ‘this country is going down the toilet.’ I’m getting tired of reading this bullsh** column.” –<em> <strong>Bo Lollar</strong>, Berry, Ala.</em><br>
			<br>
			[<em>Ed. note: You may not be enjoying the note, Mr. Lollar, but I have to tell you that your message gave me a good laugh. And it may be true that for a lot of Americans in both parties whose minds are made up, following this campaign may just not be worth it. If you know how you’re going to vote, have determined everyone who supports the other party are “insane nutsy folks” -- or at least all but .56 percent of them -- and feel like the “country is going down the toilet” then it would be pretty hard to summon interest for daily political coverage. That would be especially true if your side was struggling. I certainly hope that you would stick around since I like your style, but I also understand why campaign coverage would not be appealing to someone who feels the way you do. Sitting back and enjoying springtime in a beautiful slice of Appalachia than fretting over something about which an individual has very limited control certainly sounds appealing on a lot of levels. But please don’t just look for sources that are only going to tell you what you want to hear. That’s the ultimate waste of time in news consumption. Whatever you decide, you are most welcome here.</em>]<br>
			<br>
			“I’m not sure why you continue to highlight the Quinnipiac polls. They have always been the outlier when it comes to Trump going far back into the dim past of 2016. They were always one of the worst polls in Trump vs. Clinton. Quinnipiac usually has the most unbalanced numbers between Trump and Biden and is always the bottom dweller in Approval/Disapproval. One must wonder where they get their numbers and how they are skewed? Though you do your best to remain neutral/non-partisan in the Halftime Report, I feel an anti-Trump bias occasionally sneaks in. Otherwise, why not feature Gallup in your headline?” –<strong><em>Nemo Niemann</em></strong><em>, Elliottsburg, Pa.</em><br>
			<br>
			[<em>Ed. note: I gather from your note, Mr. Niemann, that you are a Trump supporter, so I’m sorry for the degree to which recent news has been unhappy for you. I would first and foremost remind you that we are a LONG way from the election, and much will change. It’s too soon for either side to be crabby or boastful. Starting with your last point about Gallup, they no longer do horserace polling, only presidential approval. As you’ll see above, Gallup’s approval rating poll goes right into our average every time it’s released. As for Quinnipiac, it’s certainly a top tier poll in terms of both methods and accuracy. In 2016, the school’s final poll was indeed a little less than 2 points heavy for Clinton nationally, but that’s certainly tolerable. Another thing we like about Quinnipiac polls is that they tend to come out on our schedule. Most of the other polls that are of the same quality level are from media organizations, which means they are mostly timed for the morning news. But the Q poll comes out on the afternoon, just like us. I generally encourage readers to try to focus on averages and trends and not get too hung up on one poll or another, especially this far before the election.
