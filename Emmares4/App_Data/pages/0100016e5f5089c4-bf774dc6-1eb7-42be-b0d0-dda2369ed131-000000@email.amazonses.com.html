Singles' Day is China's equivalent to Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Alibaba invested in weeks of aggressive advertising and promotions prior to the event, with ads including celebrities such as Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian. Before the event, Alibaba had to tune its business so that it could handle the upcoming increase in sales. One of the improvements was in its logistics network. Alibaba recently announced an additional $3.3 billion investment into Cainiao, a logistics unit that Alibaba co-founded six years ago. It is currently facing competition from JD.com and Pinduoduo. Singles day is an event that falls on November 11 every year that is dedicated to people who are not in a relationship.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F11%2F11%2F20959066%2Fapple-augmented-reality-ar-headset-glasses-rumors-reported-release-date/1/0100016e5f5089c4-bf774dc6-1eb7-42be-b0d0-dda2369ed131-000000/HbEhs5TCKqy_Lw61bn5VhGcfd28UD_ipWAANGA0NRUk=114" target="_blank">Apple reportedly plans 2022 release for first AR headset, followed by AR glasses in 2023 (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Apple's AR headset, codenamed N301, reportedly has AR and VR capabilities and is planned to be released in 2022. The headset will have a focus on gaming, watching video, and virtual meetings. A smaller pair of glasses that are designed to be worn for a longer period of time will be released in 2023.

Apple and other tech companies are now looking to virtual and augmented reality as the next big tech platforms. Rivals like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google have been heavily investing in AR/VR projects.

It has been almost three months since SpaceX's last launch. The Falcon 9 rocket, which had been used three times already, was able to complete its fourth landing. Falcon 9 rockets are designed to be used 10 times. This is the first time SpaceX has reused a payload fairing. Starlink aims to provide internet connectivity to areas where there is little coverage and to compete with existing internet providers in well-covered areas. Other companies, including OneWeb, TeleSat, and Amazon, are also working to provide low-Earth orbit satellite internet. Starlink may be available in the US by mid-2020. Astronomers are concerned with Starlink's presence, saying that it will impede their research and make the night sky less enjoyable.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fmainichi.jp%2Fenglish%2Farticles%2F20191111%2Fp2a%2F00m%2F0bu%2F014000c/1/0100016e5f5089c4-bf774dc6-1eb7-42be-b0d0-dda2369ed131-000000/KwGHb7KUTOcUtM5L_22co8mqugLCmUwfCcNCFMLXJuc=114" target="_blank">Reality is for the birds: New VR simulator lets people 'fly' over cities of the world (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Somniacs AG is a startup that offers a VR setup that aims to fulfill the common human dream of flying.

As many as 150 Google employees may have access to the data. Google had partnered with Ascension, a Catholic health care system that operates across 21 states and the District of Columbia. The health provider uploaded patient data to Google's Cloud servers to use a tool that could pull up individual patient pages. The data from the system is being used to design software that tailors individual patient care using machine learning. Google has been focused on health care for a while. It has previously been accused of gaining inappropriate access to hundreds of thousands of health care records through the University of Chicago Medical Center. Ascension has defended its partnership with Google, saying that all work between the companies is compliant to its strict requirements for data handling.</p> <br><br>
