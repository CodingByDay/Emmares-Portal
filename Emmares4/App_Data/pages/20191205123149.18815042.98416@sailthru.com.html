But as I age and mellow, and as awkward issues come up with replacing Libor, I am increasingly sympathetic to Libor. It does a reasonably good job of doing the thing that it was supposed to do, and that thing is maybe a bit harder than its critics think.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">So, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18815042.98416/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9yZWdpb25hbC1iYW5rcy1mYWNlLWJ1bXB5LXJvYWQtYXdheS1mcm9tLWxpYm9yLTExNTc1NDY0NDAwP21vZD1pdHBfd3NqJnJ1PXlhaG9v/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bd9773bfd" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">here</a>:</p>

That could force banks to lend at low rates at times when their own borrowing costs are rising.</p>

Here I want to make one simple point, which is: You can fund loans at Libor, but you can’t fund loans at SOFR.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">So you’re a bank. You have assets, and you fund them with liabilities. That’s what banks do: The whole business is that you borrow money from someone and lend it to someone else. Traditionally you borrow short-term and lend long-term. Most traditionally, your borrowing takes the form of bank deposits (people lend you money by putting it in checking or savings accounts at the bank), and your lending takes the form of mortgages or small-business loans or whatever. Modern banking has lots and lots of stuff that departs from this core concept—often in the form of <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18815042.98416/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDUtMDYvYmFua3MtbG9vay1zYWZlci13aXRoLWRlcG9zaXRz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B68d5569f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="PR3BMV6JIJUZ" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">regulatory requirements to borrow long-term or lend short-term</a>—but it is useful to keep that basic idea in mind.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One thing that happens in the modern financial system is that there are banks with more deposits than they can lend, and other banks who can make more loans than they have deposits. In an efficient system, the banks with extra deposits would lend those extra deposits to the banks with extra lending opportunities: The deposits at deposit-heavy banks would fund loans at loan-heavy banks. And in fact the financial system has found lots of ways to make that happen, pipes that connect banks to each other to connect deposits and loans. One way is that U.S. banks lend money to each other in the <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18815042.98416/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLm5ld3lvcmtmZWQub3JnL21hcmtldHMvYXV0b3JhdGVzL2ZlZCUyMGZ1bmRz/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bda28652c" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">federal funds market</a>. Another way is that banks lend money to each other in the <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18815042.98416/aHR0cHM6Ly9saWJlcnR5c3RyZWV0ZWNvbm9taWNzLm5ld3lvcmtmZWQub3JnLzIwMTUvMDUvdGhlLWV1cm9kb2xsYXItbWFya2V0LWluLXRoZS11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLmh0bWw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B9f0706dc" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">eurodollar market</a>. There are more complicated ways. But fed funds and eurodollars were traditionally fairly straightforward ones: Some banks had extra dollars to lend, other banks needed dollars, and so they did a straight-up trade where the banks that needed dollars borrowed the dollars from the banks that had dollars. Those markets became big and important enough that there are closely followed indexes reflecting the average interest rates on trades in those markets. In the fed funds market that index is the fed funds rate; in the eurodollar market it is Libor.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Another thing that happens in the modern financial system is a thing called “repo.” One way to describe repo is that it consists of banks (or broker-dealers, or also hedge funds) borrowing money short-term from institutional investors (often money market funds, sometimes now the Federal Reserve) and lending it long-term to the U.S. Treasury. That description is <em>not quite right</em>; it’s not exactly how people experience it. But it is correct in an important way. Repo is secured short-term borrowing, and for a big important part of the U.S. repo market the only collateral is U.S. Treasury bonds. Again the repo market is big and important, and so there’s a closely followed index rate, SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, that is <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18815042.98416/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLm5ld3lvcmtmZWQub3JnL21hcmtldHMvYXV0b3JhdGVzL3NvZnI/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B19da3fe2" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">meant to be</a> “a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.”</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If you are a bank you can go out and borrow money overnight in the repo market to buy a Treasury bond. But you can only use the money to buy a Treasury bond. You can’t borrow money in the repo market to make a mortgage loan. It is a market for banks to fund their assets, but only some of their assets. The Treasury bonds. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">In a rough sense, then, SOFR measures the cost to a bank of borrowing money to buy Treasuries, while Libor measures the cost to a bank of borrowing money to buy whatever. Well, it doesn’t quite; banks have lots of ways to borrow money to buy whatever. They can issue bonds or certificates of deposit, or they can find customers to open checking accounts that pay 0.01% interest. But Libor measures the cost of <em>one </em>way that banks borrow money to buy whatever, one potentially marginal way. (If you need a bit more money to fund a bit more loans you don’t go issue a bond, but you might borrow in overnight unsecured markets.) </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If you are a bank making floating-rate loans to customers, you will ideally want the rate on the loan to float with your cost of funding it. If you charge Libor plus 2%, then you’ll make about 2% profit each year. You can do better than that if you fund cheaper than Libor—for instance if you have a lot of checking accounts where you don’t pay much interest—but you won’t do much worse than that, because Libor is the price that you’ll pay for unsecured money that you can use to fund your loan.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If you charge SOFR plus 2.5%, then, you know, that’s a number. If you happen to get your unsecured funding at around the SOFR rate then you’ll make about 2.5% profit each year. There’s no special reason to expect that. In placid times all the interest rates will be closely related, and the rate that investors charge to lend overnight money secured by Treasuries will be close to the rate that they charge to lend overnight unsecured money to banks. In bad times the secured-by-Treasuries rate might go down while the unsecured-to-banks rate might go up, and banks that set their loan rates based on SOFR might find themselves losing money:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The shift to SOFR is particularly thorny for banks, which make money by acquiring capital at low cost and lending it at higher rates. That is because SOFR is derived from rates on repurchase agreements that use super-safe U.S. government bonds as collateral, which are essentially guaranteed to be lower than the rates at which banks can borrow.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Additionally, some bankers expect rates on variable-rate loans linked to SOFR to decline at times of economic stress, right when it typically becomes more expensive for banks to borrow. In a growing economy, Libor tends to be modestly higher than SOFR. Banks are worried that the difference will widen during a slowdown, as investors will rush into the relative safety of government debt, dragging down yields, while avoiding riskier corporate bonds, pushing those yields higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">But even beyond the arithmetic and economic problems, there is something nice about connecting the price of loans to one (highly imperfect, and less useful than it used to be) measure of the cost of making them. “Banks take in money at a cost, and then slap a markup on it, and then lend it out at a price” makes conceptual sense. “The price of a corporate loan is linked to the cost of funding Treasury bonds” does not.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The point of SOFR is that <em>it’s pretty easy to find out </em>the cost of funding Treasury bonds; that’s a big deep liquid market with lots of real transactions, so it produces a real rate. It is hard to figure out the average or prevailing or marginal cost of funding new loans: Banks get their money from lots of sources and they all have different costs of funding, and Libor is both reduced in importance as a measure of banks’ marginal funding costs and also tainted by scandal. It is not a perfect measure of the thing you want to measure. But it does try to measure that in a way that SOFR doesn’t. Every dollar that a bank raises in the SOFR market is a dollar that it can’t use to fund loans, so it’s a little weird to tie loans to SOFR.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">As you may know, I am <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18815042.98416/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDgtMDUvYmFkLWVhcm5pbmdzLW1ha2UtZ29vZC1jb21lZHk/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115Bb5d6b686" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta itemprop="suid" content="PVRTUC6K50XS"><meta itemprop="type" content="StoryLink">developing a television show</a> that will lightly fictionalize the life of hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The elevator pitch was that the Cohen character, let’s call him Sam Caplan, is “barred from the hedge fund industry after an unfortunate misunderstanding involving insider trading,” so he “moves his family office to a charming small town and gets into a series of misadventures with his quirky neighbors that ultimately cause him to learn a lot about himself and embrace his softer side.” In Season 3 he regains the ability to manage outside money, reopens his hedge fund, and has to prove himself to the outside world all over again, but his time away has changed him, and there is a continuing tension between the hard-charging hedge fund manager he was and the small-town coffeeshop regular and community-theater director he’s become, etc. etc. etc., it really writes itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">In the fictional version I think that Caplan should own the New York Mets <em>before </em>he shuts down his hedge fund, but then have to sell them to pay his SEC settlement. Then during his temporary forced retirement he will take over the management of his small town’s coed adult softball team, and we’ll be able to extract a lot of comedy from the contrast between his expectations as a former Major League Baseball owner and his new life as a small-town coed adult softball team manager. To be clear the comedy will all be about how the, like, Stars Hollow Stargazers are way better-run and more successful than the Mets. Hahahaha, the Mets.</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The owners of the New York Mets are in talks to sell up to an 80% stake of the Major League Baseball team to billionaire Steve Cohen, who is already an investor in the club, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The move would put a sometimes-controversial Wall Street figure in charge of a team that’s long sat in the shadow of the New York Yankees. Cohen, who grew up in Great Neck on Long Island rooting for the Mets, was the inspiration for the show “Billions” and his deep pockets may give hope to long-suffering fans. But the transition will take time.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Fred Wilpon, the Mets’ principal owner, will remain in his current role for at least five years, at which time Cohen would control the franchise, said the person. Jeff Wilpon, his son, will remain as the team’s chief operating officer for the five-year period, the person said. …</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Once one of baseball’s biggest spenders, the Mets went through a period of lean years.

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">There was a story of the Saudia Arabian Oil Co. initial public offering in which it was a $2 trillion company that was going to sell 5% of its stock to international investors to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy away from oil and into tech. The idea is that if you sell 5% of a $2 trillion oil company then you have $100 billion, which you can invest in tech companies, and $100 billion buys a lot of tech-company shares.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The other idea is that if you own 95% of a $2 trillion oil company then that is qualitatively different from owning 100% of that oil company: If you just own the oil company outright, you are in the oil business, but if you own 95% of the shares of that publicly traded oil company then you are in the investing business. You’ve got a portfolio of public-company shares. Yes, 95% of your portfolio is in one company, but that is just sort of an accidental characteristic of your portfolio. Your business is managing the portfolio, optimizing your investment mix. Over time you will probably sell down that one big concentrated stake and further diversify your investments, because, looking at the situation <em>as a portfolio manager</em>, that big concentrated stake is hard to justify. But you can’t look at the situation as portfolio manager until (1) you convert the oil company into a publicly traded stake and (2) you put at least <em>something </em>else in the portfolio. Before that you’re just an oil-company manager.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I don’t know. One problem is that it turns out Aramco is not a $2 trillion company that will sell 5% of its stock to international investors. It’s a $1.7 trillion company that sold about 1.5% of its stock on Saudi Arabia’s own Riyadh stock exchange, largely to local investors.

But it’s not <em>that </em>much money.

And it does; Saudi money made up a lot of SoftBank Group Corp.’s first Vision Fund. A really big international Aramco IPO might have fundamentally altered Saudi Arabia’s ability to pump money into tech companies. A smallish one doesn’t really.</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Now that Saudi Aramco is finally about to become a public company, it will have to start acting like one. And that means the share price of the state-owned oil giant will be of primary consideration to its executives and its shareholders. The kingdom’s monarchy, which will still control nearly all of Aramco’s shares after the IPO, will have particular interest in the stock price as it seeks to sell additional shares following the lock-up period. But because Aramco is a unique oil company, this could lead to unexpected OPEC oil policies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One way to think of this is that Saudia Arabia didn’t do the Aramco IPO; it is still <em>in the middle of </em>the Aramco IPO. It sold some shares, it’s got a lockup on selling some more shares for six months, but it’s still trying to get to its target of selling 5% at a $2 trillion valuation. Once Aramco has a big internationally traded float, maybe Saudi Arabia will be just another investor, but until then it is stuck running an oil company.</p>
