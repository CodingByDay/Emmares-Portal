WeWork is aiming to create a more efficient and focused organization. This layoff represents 19 percent of WeWork's total workforce. Former employees will receive severance, continued benefits, and other forms of assistance. The job cuts have been rumored for some time now. WeWork pulled its IPO filing after investors expressed concerns over the company's mounting losses and unusual corporate governance structure. Adam Neumann, one of WeWork's cofounders, has since stepped down from his role as CEO. WeWork almost ran out of money but secured a bailout from SoftBank, its biggest investor. It continues to bleed cash, with $1.25 billion in reported losses for the third quarter.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fgoogle-duplex-movie-tickets%2F/1/0100016e92cecceb-061ef0f0-3099-4da5-898e-2e36ecd20fc7-000000/XS6gfq5OhDXemcsmC0aTdZ8sjs3vaBxbOmR7w3uj8Ho=116" target="_blank">Google Duplex launches on the web, starting with movie tickets (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Duplex is launching as 'Google Assistant in Chrome' and it will be able to help users buy movie tickets.

The Reviews Are Fake (13 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Customers are being reimbursed for their Amazon purchases in exchange for positive reviews. In order to have a successful business on Amazon, vendors must have good reviews and a high search ranking. Third-party sellers often find it difficult to attract genuine customers to receive reviews when starting their businesses. Amazon has banned giving away free products in exchange for reviews, but sellers still get away with it. Sellers reach out to customers through targeted Facebook ads, giving them specific instructions for purchasing items and receiving reimbursements after leaving 5-star reviews. Using this method, customer purchases look legitimate. Having a front-page product on Amazon can be incredibly profitable, making these strategies attractive for blackhat sellers. Many of these sellers are in China. Some customers are able to gain additional benefits by earning rewards points and cash back from credit cards.</p> <br><br>
