The memo discusses some of Facebook's high-profile scandals. Bosworth claims that the reason that Trump won the 2016 election was due to him running the best digital ad campaign Bosworth had ever seen. While Facebook has enormous power to influence the outcome of the next election, Bosworth believes that the company should remain impartial and not interfere with the results.

It works by having pixels aim colors at certain angles. Delta has combined the display with AI technology to create a screen that can show individual flight information at airports. Customers will be able to view a special screen which will, to the individual, appear to only show their personal flight information. The display is currently limited in the number of colors it can show, and people need to be a certain distance away from the screen in order to view the display correctly. Delta will be deploying its first parallel-reality display at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport later this year.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.inputmag.com%2Ftech%2Fimpossible-pork-sausage-taste/1/0100016f84d936d1-b4a9c026-bb5d-42ee-9910-e33dca5dcdbd-000000/kXrE0VYJasI21QadA1puKXwgzRufejcxvpIPEGmDKh8=122" target="_blank">We ate Impossible Foods' faux pork and it was good as hell (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Impossible Foods has debuted its plant-based pork at an invite-only event at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay.

A new bill in New York proposes to create a publicly owned electronic banking platform and digital currency. The Inclusive Value Ledger proposal will allow citizens to transfer currency between each other without any fees. Local currencies were commonplace before the Federal Reserve Act centralized banking. The technology required to make IVL into a reality already exists. While the proposal says that the system will be secure, it doesn't offer more details about the planned security mechanisms or policies the system will have. The plan is supported by a coalition of community groups.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Fvideo%2Fwatch%2Fstripteasing-musk-launches-tesla-suv-pro-id654927758/1/0100016f84d936d1-b4a9c026-bb5d-42ee-9910-e33dca5dcdbd-000000/2iLZLY26TaCi--4wcvRHxhK7QwfgQkAvVHcEE2JFWgA=122" target="_blank">Stripteasing Musk launches Tesla SUV program at new China factory (1 minute video)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">This short video shows Elon Musk dancing on stage at the launch of Tesla's Model Y electric sports utility vehicle program at the new Shanghai facory as the crowd cheers him on.</p> <br><br>
