It opened its first retail store in 1993, and its product line has since grown beyond noise-canceling headphones to include smart speakers, sunglasses that double as earbuds, and more. Bose's retail stores were a place where customers could try out its products, but the needs of customers have changed and Bose is adjusting its strategy accordingly. Employees that are being laid off will be offered outplacement assistance and severance.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.themandarin.com.au%2F123628-first-ever-artificial-neuron-could-let-us-repair-brain-injuries-with-silicon%2F/1/0100016fae09c4aa-a6bb6971-08aa-4f10-8fc6-7590e1bbe450-000000/gtOTL_xDU2zmXrirT0w_5xpO3QTGGua-WKN4E_RJQlA=124" target="_blank">First-ever artificial neuron could let us repair brain injuries with silicon (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Scientists have created a 'solid-state neuron' that accurately models the behavior of biological nerve cells. It can be plugged directly into biological neural circuits to repair damage or disease. One of the challenges in building an artificial neuron is emulating a real neuron's non-linear responses. Scientists collected data from two types of rat neurons in order to build a model that emulated how neurons responded to stimuli from other nerves. The chip is roughly 0.1 millimeters in diameter and it only uses 140 nanoWatts of power, making it practical for long-term applications inside the body. Potential applications for the technology include repairing defective circuits that cause conditions like heart failure or sleep apnea, replacing damaged nerves caused by spinal injuries, or helping connect robotic limbs to people's nervous systems.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen_us%2Farticle%2Fpkebx9%2Fscientists-found-ancient-never-before-seen-viruses-in-a-glacier/1/0100016fae09c4aa-a6bb6971-08aa-4f10-8fc6-7590e1bbe450-000000/FUDOHNC6mF6lQNVbXWHJPrBEBZ_QtDlEVH3AZlaO5OE=124" target="_blank">Scientists Found Ancient, Never-Before-Seen Viruses in a Glacier (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Evidence of ancient viruses has been found deep within the glaciers atop the Tibetan Plateau. These viral records can help scientists gain data on Earth's evolutionary and climate history. Genomes from 33 groups of viruses were found in the ice, 28 that were completely new to science. Studying viruses from ice cores is difficult due to the extremely small size of the viruses and how easy it is to contaminate samples. Decontamination techniques are used to clean the samples. Warming temperatures are causing glaciers around the world to shrink and release trapped microbes and viruses. This has caused disease outbreaks in the past, and it is a concern for the future as the planet continues to warm up.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fdevdegree.ca%2F/1/0100016fae09c4aa-a6bb6971-08aa-4f10-8fc6-7590e1bbe450-000000/7DbTELG_2oP_M6pGP-T1gXl3DHk2-y7M_9Cbvz339zw=124" target="_blank">Dev Degree (Website)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Dev Degree is a learning program that combines hands-on developer experience at Shopify with an accredited Computer Science degree.

A large amount of electronic waste is generated from smartphones requiring different charging ports, and the change to a standardized port would make users' lives easier. The Radio Equipment Directive demanded the change in 2014, but the initiative was turned down. Apple has stated that changing to a common charger for all smartphones would be bad for the environment and freeze innovation. Around a billion Apple devices are using the lightning port, and the introduction of a common charger will result in an immediate increase in electronic waste, defeating the motive behind the directive. Apple may adopt a Type-C USB port in the next iPhone since it has already been introduced in the iPad and MacBook.</p> <br><br>
