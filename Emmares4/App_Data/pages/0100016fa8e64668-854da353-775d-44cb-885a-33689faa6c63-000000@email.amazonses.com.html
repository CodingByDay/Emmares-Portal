Akon City will be the world’s first crypto city. The city will have its own digital currency, Akoin. Akon is of Senegalese descent and has been planning the city for at least 18 months.

Until now, livers could only be kept alive outside of the body for 12 hours. Livers kept alive inside the machine can regenerate. In trials, six out of ten livers deemed unsuitable for transplant were able to recover to full functionality within one week of being hooked up to the machine. The ability to regenerate livers so they are suitable for transplant is a huge moment in medical history. Liver4Life was developed over four years, and it mimics body processes such as circulation, blood filtering, and movement.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fawslabs%2Fautogluon/1/0100016fa8e64668-854da353-775d-44cb-885a-33689faa6c63-000000/mbuWY3QtCzeLd6PltC9Tw8d8iM2u0MRbjJjxs8jjILM=123" target="_blank">AutoGluon: AutoML Toolkit for Deep Learning (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">AutoGluon can train and deploy high-accuracy deep learning models for image, text, and tabular data with just a few lines of code.

(4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Computer programming has changed significantly in the last 20 years, and this blog post contains a long list of things that have changed. Some programming concepts like immutability, pattern matching, and tail recursion are now commonly used. A lot of desktop software is now just a webpage bundled with a browser. Package management ecosystems are now prevalent, and people no longer have to search through random websites and follow complicated instructions to install libraries. Security has become more of a focus. There are many other changes listed in the article.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Ftesla-cybertruck-shirt-bulletproof-pokes-fun-at-launch-2020-1/1/0100016fa8e64668-854da353-775d-44cb-885a-33689faa6c63-000000/yLr01ZK6I42ovGlZglocKc0Gka-BjQIs3_rtGkxLLxg=123" target="_blank">Tesla is now selling a $45 'bulletproof' t-shirt that pokes fun at the surprising moment when its Cybertruck launch event went off the rails (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Tesla has released a t-shirt for sale that has an image of shattered glass on the front and the Cybertruck logo on the back, referencing the mishap during the reveal of the Cybertruck in November.

Many ad providers rely on cookies to target and track advertising, so the change is likely to have a large impact on the industry. The move is designed to encourage publishers, advertising companies, and other browser providers to help Google create a new set of privacy-focused, open web standards. Google is looking for ideas on how the web without third-party cookies could work, and will not implement the change until a solution is found that addresses the needs of users, publishers, and advertisers. Anti-tracking features are becoming more common in browsers. This has affected publishers and advertisers, so an alternative to the cookie system is required to preserve the industry.</p> <br><br>
