CEO Rus Yusupov sent a note to employees informing them of the company's closure. HQ had received an acquisition offer from an established business but the deal didn't go through. The HQ Trivia app launched in 2017 and it quickly became popular due to its novel live nature, real cash prizes, and Scott Rogowsky playing the game's host. As the game became less popular, HQ tried to keep users engaged through extra in-game lives and an in-person event with a cash prize, but eventually, the game's novelty wore off and the company wasn't able to keep its users interested in its games.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F02%2F13%2Fnetflix-fends-off-new-streaming-rivals-by-way-of-samsung-partnership%2F/1/0100017052d8b333-6109fdf1-8ee6-4d0a-8658-d52fa750c2b6-000000/Orf_sgGQIKrpKI7sNYb3Viota8GG_DZlvMJ4IFIQjdg=128" target="_blank">Netflix fights new streaming rivals with Samsung partnership (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Samsung announced a deal with Netflix at its Unpacked event last week that will bring special Netflix original show content to its Galaxy smartphones.

Netflix will be more deeply integrated with Samsung devices. Users will be able to launch Netflix via Bixby and view recommendations on Samsung Daily. Netflix subscriber growth has stagnated in the US. Most of its competitors already have integrations with mobile devices or partnerships that allow them to distribute their service to millions.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fventurebeat.com%2F2020%2F02%2F11%2Fhow-ai-is-fighting-and-could-enable-ransomware-attacks-on-cities%2F/1/0100017052d8b333-6109fdf1-8ee6-4d0a-8658-d52fa750c2b6-000000/qoYDdLOSm0OszNsBAVjcPiRK4-cG5LQuu6mZ8H3BALg=128" target="_blank">How AI is fighting, and could enable, ransomware attacks on cities (8 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Modern infrastructure is based on computers and technology, and many parts of society would stop functioning in the event of a ransomware attack. Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts or controls computer systems until the victim pays the criminal a ransom. Increasingly, cities, public utilities, and public-facing institutions are being targeted. Security experts are using AI to improve the effectiveness of malware attack defenses, but criminals might also begin using AI to improve ransomware and plot more efficient attacks. It is likely that ransomware won't be seen in the wild for another one to three years, but AI can already be used to find vulnerable targets in an organization. Scientists have created in-house AI malware, so it is a real possibility. The upcoming elections may be a potential target for attacks by nation-state actors.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.nasa.gov%2Fpress-release%2Fexplorers-wanted-nasa-to-hire-more-artemis-generation-astronauts/1/0100017052d8b333-6109fdf1-8ee6-4d0a-8658-d52fa750c2b6-000000/MQglC4J4MMJ4DW3Suu4tLa7_OXmaxVJHec_O_Hxg-mQ=128" target="_blank">Explorers Wanted: NASA to Hire More Artemis Generation Astronauts (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">NASA will be accepting applications for the next class of Artemis Generation astronauts between March 2 and 31.

The transfer and allocation of old banknotes across provinces has been cut off between the cities most affected by the deadly outbreak. 600 billion yuan cash has been created for Hubei. Money is being sanitized with ultraviolet rays or heated up and locked up for 14 days in the most affected areas, and money from less risky areas is subject to a week of quarantine. Commercial lenders have been asked to separate cash from hospitals and food markets. Mobile payments have largely replaced banknotes in daily life in China, but older people still tend to prefer using bank notes for everyday transactions.</p> <br><br>
