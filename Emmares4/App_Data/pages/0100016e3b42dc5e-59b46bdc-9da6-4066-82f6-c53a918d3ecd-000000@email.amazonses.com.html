Facebook's products include the Facebook App, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, Workplace, Portal, and Calibra. In June, it started adding 'from Facebook' within all its apps.

Uber has until Friday to appeal the decision. Meanwhile, customers can still rent out equipment through the Jump app. Uber has threatened to sue the city over the suspension. LA has attempted to implement a data-sharing rule which would require Uber to share real-time data on all trips made within the city. Uber has resisted the rule, saying that the policy constitutes government surveillance and that the data would reveal sensitive information about customers. LA officials say that the data was necessary to identify companies in violation of permit rules, including caps on the number of vehicles and bans on riding in certain areas.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fchina%2Fscience%2Farticle%2F3036119%2Fchina-approves-oligomannate-worlds-first-new-alzheimers-drug-20/1/0100016e3b42dc5e-59b46bdc-9da6-4066-82f6-c53a918d3ecd-000000/kK2GNsd45Hq5T9lN90PUj9fGNOf186Abz_2SgZo2Sz0=113" target="_blank">China approves Oligomannate, world’s first new Alzheimer’s drug in 20 years and it is based on seaweed (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">China has approved the first new drug for Alzheimer's disease in nearly two decades. Oligomannate could potentially reverse the condition and is based on a unique sugar found in seaweed. It was inspired by an observation that there was a relatively low occurrence of Alzheimer's among the elderly who regularly consumed seaweed. The drug has been proven effective on conditions up to stage 4. It will not cure brains that have degenerated beyond repair. Oligomannate reduces the formation of a protein that is harmful to neurons and regulates bacterium colonies in the intestines to reduce the risk of brain inflammation.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fventurebeat.com%2F2019%2F11%2F04%2Fmicrosoft-announces-azure-quantum-a-cloud-quantum-computing-service%2F/1/0100016e3b42dc5e-59b46bdc-9da6-4066-82f6-c53a918d3ecd-000000/aRPn-tQLoM6mVCzdXwho2Gn2kn_8CLjE_s232hRZbR0=113" target="_blank">Microsoft announces Azure Quantum, a cloud quantum computing service (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Microsoft has announced plans to release an open cloud quantum computer service in private preview.

It currently only supports Chrome and Chromium Edge. Developers can now go to Visual Studio Online to access remote environments from common templates, clone from a GitHub repo, and edit code in a browser. Visual Studio Online will allow developers to work from anywhere on any device. New environments can be created quickly, which cuts down setup time to just a couple of minutes. Visual Studio Online's environments are Azure-hosted. They can easily scale and developers pay for what they use down to the second. Self-hosted environments can be connected to use Visual Studio Online for free.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbayard-search%2Fbayard/1/0100016e3b42dc5e-59b46bdc-9da6-4066-82f6-c53a918d3ecd-000000/zmq-U6WhDlv8iAebzh-twwPMN8BpapwoaITUZ6dydEo=113" target="_blank">Bayard (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Bayard is a full-text search and indexing server.

It’s not just about the hours (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Britain's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has recently pledged to reduce the standard working week to 32 hours, without loss of pay, within 10 years of winning office. He says that people should work to live, not live to work. While fewer working hours may have economic benefits through optimal resource allocation, it is also an ethically desirable goal. Fewer working hours mean that people would be generally happier as they have more time. However, having more time doesn't mean that all the time is spent on doing what people want to do. A lot of the extra time will probably be spent on doing things that are required to be done.</p> <br><br>
