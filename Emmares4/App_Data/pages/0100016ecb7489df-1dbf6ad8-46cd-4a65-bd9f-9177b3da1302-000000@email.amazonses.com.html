Users who have autism, Down syndrome, facial disfigurements, or other disabilities may have their videos restricted to only be shown in their own country and removed from the For You feed. TikTok claims that the restriction on these videos was a temporary measure and that it has since altered its rules. The short-form video service has previously been accused of censoring users who express certain political opinions.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2019%2F12%2F02%2Faws-launches-braket-its-quantum-computing-service%2F/1/0100016ecb7489df-1dbf6ad8-46cd-4a65-bd9f-9177b3da1302-000000/hKwlRYOM1S97gmvzLX_LjSwbNbvjiJdXsRBnW7ALG-c=117" target="_blank">AWS launches Braket, its quantum computing service (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Amazon Web Services has partnered with D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti to launch Braket, a quantum computing service.

Braket will have a fully managed Jupyter notebook environment for developers to explore their algorithms. Amazon will provide plenty of pre-installed developer tools, sample algorithms, and tutorials. Researchers will have access to collaboration tools through Amazon's new Solutions Lab. Its Center for Quantum Computing will focus on making the technology more accessible to developers.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2019%2F12%2F02%2Fesa-approves-hera-asteroid-deflection-ission%2F/1/0100016ecb7489df-1dbf6ad8-46cd-4a65-bd9f-9177b3da1302-000000/aJCv_IYmiJzB9I0wOyyj-L7ImoLyv4vV2soQRR1bBIc=117" target="_blank">Europe's space agency approves the Hera anti-asteroid mission (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The ministers in charge of the European Space Agency have approved a $320 million mission to test whether deflection could save the planet from a rogue asteroid. The ESA and NASA will send a pair of spacecraft to a double-asteroid system called Didymos. NASA will first crash its DART probe into the smaller asteroid, Didymoon. Hera will then map the impact crater and measure the asteroid's mass. Didymoon is the size of the Great Pyramid, so it could destroy an entire city if it impacted Earth. The mission is tricky as no spacecraft has ever flown to such tiny space bodies before. An asteroid collision is an unlikely event, but it is preventable, unlike earthquakes or volcanic explosions.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Fscience%2F2019%2F12%2F01%2Fscientists-use-loudspeakers-to-make-dead-coral-reefs-sound-healthy-and-fish-flock-to-them/1/0100016ecb7489df-1dbf6ad8-46cd-4a65-bd9f-9177b3da1302-000000/h4FqGVEzCKFWFcdWUBIDCj8lYpjcgrVNszV0W3t0XKg=117" target="_blank">Scientists use loudspeakers to make dead coral reefs sound healthy, and fish flock to them (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Scientists have used a process called 'acoustic enrichment' to attract fish back to dead coral reefs. Coral reefs have been dying due to climate change, overfishing, and pollution. Degraded reefs have a better chance of recovering if they have robust populations of fish. In an experiment, scientists played recordings from a healthy reef in patches of dead coral. The areas where these recordings were played had twice as many fish compared to patches where no sound was played. Fish that had migrated to the area tended to stay. The new fish populations included species from all parts of the food chain.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffastai%2Fnbdev%2F/1/0100016ecb7489df-1dbf6ad8-46cd-4a65-bd9f-9177b3da1302-000000/iWMYikLx9vt9F0sI3wYOgugYuerKZrsrKbO3Y5TZ98o=117" target="_blank">nbdev (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">nbdev allows developers to fully develop a library in Jupyter Notebooks.

Match Group carries out background checks for its paid services. It doesn't collect enough information on users of free apps to conduct meaningful background checks. Match Group owns 45 online dating brands and reported $1.7 billion in revenue in 2018.</p> <br><br>
