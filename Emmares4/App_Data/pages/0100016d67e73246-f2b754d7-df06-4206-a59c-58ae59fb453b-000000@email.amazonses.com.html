Neumann will remain a non-executive chairman and the CEO role will be split between Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson. WeWork still plans to go public this year. Neumann will no longer have majority voting control. SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son led the charge to remove Neumann due to long term disagreements. WeWork executives have been considering cost reduction measures which may include laying off a third of WeWork's employees as well as closing ancillary businesses.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2019%2F09%2F24%2Famazon-launches-employee-health-clinic-amazon-care.html/1/0100016d67e73246-f2b754d7-df06-4206-a59c-58ae59fb453b-000000/OZiUZxwhCPnO-yQQ0HlV5FOCUdHRhqOQVXjy1z-KGzM=107" target="_blank">Amazon launches Amazon Care, a virtual medical clinic for employees (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Amazon has launched a virtual health clinic with in-home follow-ups for Amazon employees and their families in Seattle.

The deal is the most substantial acquisition Facebook has made since acquiring Oculus VR. CTRL-Labs' wristband will allow for the development of new ways of interacting with machines. The acquisition of CTRL-Labs represents Facebook's commitment to futuristic tech. It has recently been revealed that Facebook is designing two different models of AR glasses which are prime candidates for CTRL-Labs' interface technology. </p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F9%2F24%2F20880511%2Fboston-dynamics-spot-robot-mini-hands-on-lease-buy/1/0100016d67e73246-f2b754d7-df06-4206-a59c-58ae59fb453b-000000/szwgO5mbIHnwLp2OhtoZRCm6k2A8dbh8NhADqKUMqF4=107" target="_blank">Boston Dynamics’ Spot is leaving the laboratory (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Boston Dynamics will be releasing its Spot robot to companies who have good uses for it. Spot is able to go where you tell it, avoid obstacles, and keep its balance under extreme circumstances. It can carry up to four hardware modules on its back, so companies can swap in whatever skills the robot needs for its jobs. Boston Dynamics is focusing on uses in closed and controlled spaces. The company has stated that they are not interested in Spot being used as a weapon. Spot's model of the world is pretty shallow, consisting mostly of obstacles, footholds, and preprogrammed routes. It is not designed to interact with humans. Academic roboticists usually develop human-robot interaction skills early in development as it is harder to retrofit human interaction into existing systems, so Spot's inability to interact with human beings remains a major question mark for the project's future. </p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdenisidoro%2Fnavi/1/0100016d67e73246-f2b754d7-df06-4206-a59c-58ae59fb453b-000000/apnwuryGsT7abuyXE6z4JQcNn4dragfoneP5mNzmAOc=107" target="_blank">navi (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">navi is an interactive cheatsheet tool for the command line.

HCL has been active in discouraging contractors from unionizing. Google has stated that it will continue to partner with HCL. Many HCL employees are concerned that they are paid less than Google staffers and receive fewer benefits, with almost no job security, despite completing similar work. Contracted workers are usually unable to discuss their work or pay. There have been more instances of tech workers supporting unionization within the last year. </p> <br><br>
