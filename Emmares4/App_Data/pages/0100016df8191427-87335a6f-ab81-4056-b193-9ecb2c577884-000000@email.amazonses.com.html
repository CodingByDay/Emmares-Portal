Facebook has said it will not launch Libra until it receives regulatory approval. Zuckerberg will argue that Libra will extend America's financial leadership and democratic values around the world. He argues against the idea that Libra is an attempt to replace sovereign currency and that Libra was created only to be an alternative to existing online payment systems.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theregister.co.uk%2F2019%2F10%2F22%2Fjapanese_hotel_chain_sorry_that_bedside_robots_may_have_watched_guests/1/0100016df8191427-87335a6f-ab81-4056-b193-9ecb2c577884-000000/yGjCbGw0iqbyfKYPmDJ18Q1Af4WKnJvpm7O5a4aI-lE=111" target="_blank">Japanese hotel chain sorry that hackers may have watched guests through bedside robots (1 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A hotel chain in Japan uses robots that perform tasks that human employees usually do, for example, check-in guests, showing guests their rooms, and assist with other requirements. The hotels use facial recognition to unlock doors. A few months ago, a security researcher discovered a vulnerability on the robots that allowed easy access to stream video and audio from the robots. The researcher notified the hotel group about the vulnerability but received no reply, so he made the hack public. After the hack was revealed, the hotel group apologized for the vulnerability and patched the software.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fscitechdaily.com%2Fpowered-by-sunlight-artificial-leaf-successfully-produces-clean-gas-from-co2-and-water%2F/1/0100016df8191427-87335a6f-ab81-4056-b193-9ecb2c577884-000000/RLl4IWNeMY-xfO07lOoLmgIAD-cqvHyxulSVj0hQkJU=111" target="_blank">Powered by Sunlight, ‘Artificial Leaf’ Successfully Produces Clean Gas From CO2 and Water (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Syngas is a gas usually created from fossil fuels that is used to produce a range of commodities, such as fuels, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and fertilizers. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have created an artificial leaf that is able to produce syngas in a sustainable and simple way. The leaf works by using a combination of two light absorbers and a cobalt-based catalyst. It is able to work in low light, even when it is rainy or overcast. The technology may be able to eventually produce a sustainable liquid fuel alternative to petrol.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotadamking%2Ftensortrade/1/0100016df8191427-87335a6f-ab81-4056-b193-9ecb2c577884-000000/Ji80MJOZu4necp8OWwIu2NT7a5daU4-MuIrQoh8rLEo=111" target="_blank">TensorTrade (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">TensorTrade is an open-source Python framework for building, training, evaluating, and deploying robust trading algorithms using reinforcement learning.
