<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If you are a good smart quantitative investor, you have a model that tells you what stocks to buy. You’ll buy more shares of the stocks that have high probabilities of going up a lot, and fewer shares of the stocks that have lower probabilities of going up less, and you’ll short shares of companies that have high probabilities of going down a lot. You will have a complete, probabilistic world view that can be expressed by some linear combination of shares of all of the available stocks.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If you’re just a regular old investor, the same thing will be true in some rough sense: You’ll own the stocks you like, in the amounts you like, and short the stocks you don’t like, etc., and some probabilistic world view can be inferred from the set of shares that you own. You don’t necessarily think of your investing that way, but it can be characterized that way.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">In fact, if you want, you can characterize <em>all </em>the shares owned by <em>all </em>the investors that way: People own the shares of stock they want to own, in the amounts and at the prices they want, and if you add all of them together you get the aggregated world view of everyone in the financial markets. If the prices of social media companies go up then that means that people are more bullish on social media; if people are bearish on retail stores then the prices of retail shares will go down, etc.; the total views of everyone in the market are expressed in the prices of stocks. This is all pretty standard stuff. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">One question you might ask, if you’re weird, is: Can you do the same thing using not <em>shares of stock </em>but instead <em>exchange-traded funds</em>? That is, given a world view expressible by some linear combination of all the stocks, can you <em>instead </em>express that world view by some linear combination of all the ETFs? The answer is more or less yes:</p>
<blockquote style="Margin: 0 0 1.25em; color: #6F6F6F; border-left: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0.5625em 1.25em 0 1.1875em; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none">
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Although it is common to view ETFs as index products, they can also be tools for price discovery that are increasingly used by hedge funds and active managers to express views on sectors, industries, countries, regions, capitalization ranges, and factors.</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">ETF prices are determined on organized exchanges through the interaction of supply and demand. We show that if these prices are correct, then the underlying constituents can be priced from the funds’ market determined prices even if there is no trading or liquidity in the underlying stocks. In other words, the fund prices can suffice for price discovery! …</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Efficient price discovery of underlying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 can occur through ETFs or through trades of the underlying stocks themselves—but this has only been the case fairly recently since 2015. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">That’s from a paper called “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18665611.137610/aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXBlcnMuc3Nybi5jb20vc29sMy9wYXBlcnMuY2ZtP2Fic3RyYWN0X2lkPTM0NjU4ODg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B3a010d7f" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">What Happens with More Funds Than Stocks?</a>” by Ananth Madhavan, Aleksander Sobczyk and Andrew Ang of BlackRock Inc. The paper covers other, arguably more practical topics, but this particular result is a pure conclusion of linear algebra: It just means that there are enough ETFs that own enough stocks with different enough weights that you can reconstruct any combination of stock weights by owning (or shorting) ETFs instead. (I mean, for stocks in the S&amp;P 500; not for stocks in the world.) It is not particularly practical advice. You <em>wouldn’t</em> do that. Investing through ETFs involves overhead—you have to pay the ETFs’ expense ratios—that investing in stocks doesn’t, so if you had an actual list of stocks that you wanted to buy you’d just buy the stocks rather than reconstructing the list through ETFs.[1]</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Still! For one thing it is just, as matrix algebra goes, a funny thing to think about. For another thing, there really is a popular controversy these days about whether the rise of ETFs will reduce market efficiency. <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18665611.137610/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTYtMDgtMjQvYXJlLWluZGV4LWZ1bmRzLWNvbW11bmlzdA/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B00792cec" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="OCFH1E6K50XX" itemprop="suid"><meta content="StoryLink" itemprop="type">People worry</a> that if everyone invests through passive-ish vehicles like ETFs, then stock prices will no longer reflect investors’ world views, and the market will no longer allocate capital efficiently to the best projects. As a matter of linear algebra, that is apparently untrue. As an intuitive matter, the point here is that <em>buying an ETF itself expresses a world view</em>, and there are enough different ETFs expressing enough different world views to get to market efficiency.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">I wrote above that this is not particularly practical advice because, if you had a worldview expressed in a list of stocks to buy, it would be inefficient to represent that worldview in the form of a list of ETFs instead. But that is perhaps an old-fashioned way of thinking. Why would you naturally express your worldview in terms of <em>stocks</em>? Why would you think “social media is good so I will buy Facebook,” or whatever? Why wouldn’t you instead think “social media is good so I will buy the Social Media ETF”? Or even more complicated things: If you think that social media is good but governance is important, you might go long the Social Media ETF and short the Bad Governance ETF rather than long Facebook Inc. and short Snap Inc.[2]</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The point is that funds might be a more natural vehicle than companies to express world views: It might make more intuitive sense, for ordinary investors, to redescribe the stock market as a set of themes or ideas or factors, and let you choose which themes you like and what weights you want to give them, and leave the work of translating those themes into actual stocks to someone else. “I think millennials are where it’s at,” you say, and buy the Millennials ETF, and your money gets allocated to actual companies without your giving it any further thought. There is something natural and intuitive about that: Why should regular investors have to allocate their money to <em>companies</em>; why can’t they allocate it to <em>abstract theses</em>? </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">But then there is a sort of formal and practical question, something like: Are there enough theses to go around? Can the market allocate money to actual projects by just aggregating up everyone’s views on abstract themes? And in some loose way the answer is, sure, why not; there are more ETFs, and <em>they express more different ideas</em>, than there are stocks, so maybe they can do as good a job—even a better job—of allocating capital.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">The idea here is that banks lend each other money in short-term funding markets, and the rates at which they lend each other money provide key benchmarks for trillions of dollars’ worth of floating-rate loans and interest-rate derivatives. Traditionally the big benchmark was <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18665611.137610/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY21lZ3JvdXAuY29tL2VkdWNhdGlvbi9jb3Vyc2VzL2ludHJvZHVjdGlvbi10by1ldXJvZG9sbGFycy93aGF0LWlzLWxpYm9yLXdoYXQtaXMtZXVyb2RvbGxhci5odG1s/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B6fa6cfc1" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">Libor</a>, the London interbank offered rate, which measures the rate at which banks borrow unsecured money in Eurodollar markets. Libor became scandalous, though, because it was based on banks self-reporting the going rate, and it turned out that banks sometimes lied about the rate either to make themselves look better or to make money on their interest-rate derivatives. </p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">And so … well the straightforward story is “and so regulators decided to get rid of Libor and replace it with other rates that are based on observable market transactions.” In the U.S. that rate is called <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18665611.137610/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLm5ld3lvcmtmZWQub3JnL21hcmtldHMvYXV0b3JhdGVzL3NvZnI/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B903a443d" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta itemprop="type" content="WebLink">SOFR</a>, the secured overnight funding rate, which measures the rate at which banks borrow secured money overnight in repo markets.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">But the actual story isn’t quite that straightforward, and in fact there are still several rates jockeying to be <em>the </em>interest rate benchmark. Libor was a very useful benchmark because it was more or less the marginal cost at which banks funded their floating-rate loans; SOFR, being an overnight secured rate for financing Treasury securities, is not quite as good, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18665611.137610/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9taWNoYWVsZGVsY2FzdGlsbG8vMjAxOS8xMS8xOS9saWJvci1jb21wZXRpdG9yLWFkdmlzZWQtYnktZm9ybWVyLWNmdGMtY2hhaXJtYW4tY2hyaXMtZ2lhbmNhcmxvLW1pbnRzLTItZXRoZXJldW0tdG9rZW5zLyMxZDhlYzlkMzNkYzg/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B165f03fb" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">particularly for smaller banks</a> that don’t do a lot of repoing of Treasuries.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">And so, despite the regulators’ desires, there is still a demand for a benchmark interest rate that reflects banks’ unsecured lending to each other. <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18665611.137610/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaWNlLmNvbS9pYmEvbGlib3I/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B2b83a368" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta itemprop="type" content="WebLink">Libor is still around</a>, and not purely as a declining vestige; the post-scandal administration of Libor makes a big deal about how it is now based on observable transactions and not as manipulable as it once was. </p>

It’s an unsecured interbank rate, like Libor, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18665611.137610/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZmUuY2JvZS5jb20vY2ZlLXByb2R1Y3RzL2FtZXJpYm9yLWZ1dHVyZXM/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B2191dfe1" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta itemprop="type" content="WebLink">but it</a> “is based on actual market transactions, not estimates or submissions,” so you can trust it in a way you didn’t trust Libor.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">And if you didn’t trust it before, now you can extra trust it, because it is on the blockchain! I have no idea why it would be good that it’s on the blockchain. But it’s on the blockchain. The point here is not so much that putting it on the blockchain is good or useful; the point is that there is a huge, relatively new demand for attaching <em>signals of trustworthiness </em>to interest-rate benchmarks. In the old days the way you tried to define an interest-rate benchmark was by thinking about what calculation process would best reflect the economic reality that you cared about, which might—for over-the-counter name-specific markets like unsecured bank funding—actually mean just calling up banks and asking them their funding costs. Now the way you try to define an interest-rate benchmark is by thinking about what calculation process will make people think “oh this is not like Libor, this is based on transparent real trades, no one can lie about this.” And if you want people to believe that you are giving them transparent real immutable data about transactions, there are few words that are as evocative these days as “blockchain.” It’s a good shorthand way of saying “we’re not just making up this number, there is a real audit trail that shows you how we got it.” So, yes, put your interest rates on the blockchain.</p>

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If you graduate from college and go to work as an investment banker, what you’ll do, if you’re lucky, is build financial models to help companies figure out how much they should pay to buy other companies. I mean really what you’ll do is mostly format working group lists and pitchbooks; the financial modeling is the <em>good </em>part, the high-profile, substantive work that adds value for your clients.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">If you stick it out as an investment banker for 20 years and become a star rainmaker, your work, and the way you add value for your clients, will change. Sure yes sometimes they will call you for a financial model, and you will tell a VP to tell an associate to tell an analyst to build the model and send it to the client. But often you will be doing other things, softer and fuzzier and harder-to-quantify things, big-picture things rather than spreadsheets. You’ll help the client figure out what companies to buy based on strategic fit, and you’ll help her buy those companies by advising her on negotiating tactics. Especially, you’ll help her buy those companies by <em>introducing her to them</em>; your value will come from knowing the whole industry on a deep personal level, knowing who might get along with whom and how to connect them so as to make a deal happen.</p>
<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">It is significant that a lot of star investment bankers leave big banks, not just for smaller boutique banks, but for what are sometimes called “<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18665611.137610/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvOTdhNTAxY2MtMTQ4ZS0xMWUyLWFhOTMtMDAxNDRmZWFiZGMw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B9fa73873" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline"><meta content="WebLink" itemprop="type">kiosks</a>”: tiny advisory firms that employ only a handful of senior bankers, or sometimes just one, rather than armies of junior bankers. That probably doesn’t mean that they’re building their own spreadsheets. It means that there is an essential core business of investment banking that can be done <em>without spreadsheets</em>, that what (some) senior investment bankers fundamentally trade on is strategic vision and personal contacts, not financial analysis. I mean presumably they internalized a lot of financial analysis back in the day, but anyway they’ve left the spreadsheets behind.</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">Tiger Chark wasn’t involved in the deal negotiations and is not a financial adviser in the traditional sense, the people added.</p>

To be clear, it’s <em>not </em>an investment banking kiosk; it’s a “‘strategic brand consulting firm’ that develops ‘broad visions for consumer products’” run by a Wharton graduate named Lisa Manice, and it combines “millennial insight with the sage advice of industry experts.” But strategic brand consulting overlaps at some points with M&amp;A banking; really at a high enough level the roles of all of a company’s professional advisers blend together. There is some level of M&amp;A advisory work in which the essential things are (1) knowing to tell the client “hey you should buy Kylie Jenner’s company,” (2) knowing <em>which </em>client to tell that, and (3) knowing Kylie Jenner’s phone number. You don’t have to spend years building spreadsheets to be able to do that.</p>

At these locations, free coffee, tea and other drinks are still available. Other locations will be shuttered by the end of the year, some of the people said. …</p>
<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The decision to remove some of the Honesty Market stands was made several months ago, some of the people with knowledge of the matter said.

It would be interesting to see a chart over time of WeWork Honesty Market shrinkage: Do people take snacks without paying more now than they used to? (Or did they always take snacks without paying, but now venture capital won’t subsidize the snacks?) When WeWork was a fast-growing booming sexy tech company that was also somehow elevating the world’s consciousness, maybe everyone was like “better pay for my potato chips, because of the consciousness, and also WeWork’s tech is so good they will probably know if I don’t.” Now that WeWork is a fast-shrinking fiasco whose founder walked away with a <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/18665611.137610/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMTAtMjMvaG93LWRvLXlvdS1saWtlLXdlLW5vdw/5daec32c52ba1e0621725115B74bc4d8b" itemprop="StoryLink" itemscope="itemscope" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">billion-dollar payout</a>, maybe everyone’s consciousness has been lowered and they’re just like “ooh free potato chips.”</p>

<p style="Margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em; color: #343434">The fact nobody is selling for cash has put CC at a massive premium: those who had got in early on endangered, prestige or hard-to-breed animals are now hoarding them, only selling them for wild sums.

<p style="color: #343434; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25px; Margin-bottom: 1em">Instead, everyone just breeds Indian peafowl, ostriches and warthogs to grind out CCs. “Apart from anything else, it’s sad that a system meant to reward the emulation of real conservation practices has instead created a world where zoos are cynically churning out millions of genetically busted warthogs, into a wilderness where they’re not even endangered.” I do not know if it is a metaphor for anything but it sure is weird.</p>
