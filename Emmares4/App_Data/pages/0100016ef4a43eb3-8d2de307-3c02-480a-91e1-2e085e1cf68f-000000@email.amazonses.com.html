Korey will remain as executive chairman of the company. Away has been searching for a CEO since spring after Korey's management style was criticized as being harsh. The story around Korey's dismissal has been building for several months. It was reported that Korey had created a toxic culture within the startup. However, many of the sources were probably disgruntled ex-employees. Some of the circumstances around the story suggest that the company had been trying to remove Korey for some time.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fonezero.medium.com%2Farchitects-are-playing-with-the-future-of-design-in-video-games-1352a2d3ae3f/1/0100016ef4a43eb3-8d2de307-3c02-480a-91e1-2e085e1cf68f-000000/KTZP4ExrYPIdEldnm22PJ94nl7KhZao8RdHhxB0dKxc=118" target="_blank">Architects Are Playing With the Future of Design in Video Games (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Games are built on code. Code is written to define the physics and possibilities of a game, and it is used to create a visual world that players can exist in. In the real world, objects and materials have set physical properties, but in games, these can be altered to whatever the programmers want it to be. Games could be a good place to train architects. Architects can be free to build whatever they want to while also testing out concepts in controlled environments. Building in games requires understanding, and sometimes writing, the rules which certain materials have to follow, and this could result in more creative uses of materials in the real world.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Froadshow%2Fnews%2Fself-driving-semi-plus-ai-cross-country%2F/1/0100016ef4a43eb3-8d2de307-3c02-480a-91e1-2e085e1cf68f-000000/N10oj0Q1kiEvK_Uj0L5BBFq0i_j7bLUSoyq5RkB18pg=118" target="_blank">Self-driving semi makes first cross-country trip, thanks to Plus.ai tech (1 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Residents in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, will soon have their food delivered to grocery stores via a self-driving semi-truck.

It crossed $3.28 billion in North America and $6.7 billion overseas over the weekend. These numbers don't include Fox titles, which if included, would push the record up to $11.9 billion. Disney established a new record in August for having five movies cross $1 billion in a single year. Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker could potentially put that number to seven movies for the year. Disney currently holds six of the 10 biggest movies of the year globally, including Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing film of all time.</p> <br><br>
